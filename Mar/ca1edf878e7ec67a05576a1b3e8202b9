ANC Election Chair Fikile Mbalula on Wednesday said the ANC Youth League  (ANCYL) got to be militant and and lead youth struggles within the guidance of the organisation. Mbalula said, during his tenure as ANCYL president, members also suffered with issues of identity, from Peter Mokaba, Lulu Johnson and Malusi Gigaba. “I think the Youth League will always struggle with identities, as its leaders will always be compared to Julius Malema. As the ANCYL, we have always suffered with issues of identity from Peter Mokaba, Lulu Johnson, myself and Malusi Gigaba,” Mbalula said. On pleas for Malema to return to the ANC, Mbalula said the organisation is where it is today because some people who presided over the now EFF leader’s expulsion were now calling for him to come back. “I defended Julius Malema in difficult times, before he could be expelled from the ANC and the fact of the matter is that today we are here with some people who presided over his expulsion calling for him to come back to the ANC.” During the voter registration weekend, both President Cyril Ramaphosa and Deputy President David Mabuza urged Malema to return “home”. -Sipho Jack
