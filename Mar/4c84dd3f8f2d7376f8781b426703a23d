The Gauteng department of human settlements on Tuesday condemned the recent land grab invasions that took place in the Olievenhoutbosch area in Tshwane at the weekend. This comes after a group of alleged EFF supporters invaded land in Olievenhoutbosch near Centurion in Pretoria on Saturday, as per apparent instruction from local EFF leadership. The land grabbing activities continued until Monday, despite warnings from Gauteng Premier David Makhura for community members to refrain from such acts, as they are illegal. Head of department Matilda Gasela has called on law enforcement agencies to take the necessary action against those who continue to illegally invade land. “The department is concerned that there are criminal elements within the community who continuously mislead the community. We call on law enforcement agencies to take strong action against them,” Gasela said. During his voter registration campaign in Tshwane on Sunday, President Cyril Ramaphosa condemned illegal land grabbing activities. Meanwhile, lobby group AfriForum has blamed the EFF and the president for “their irresponsible statements” on these land grabbing incidences. AfriForum warned on Monday that the “land grab alliance” between EFF leader Julius Malema and Ramaphosa could lead to a state of anarchy. Gasela said the department had since “obtained an interdict against further invasion of houses in the area” and was also evicting community members who had invaded houses. “It seems that there is a group that has concerted efforts to bring anarchy in the community of Olievenhoutbosch. We call on the community not to be misled by opportunists.” -TNA Reporter
