Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina says that he has no ‘conspiratory’ relationship with the taxi industry despite them having expressed their dissatisfaction with him during their march last week. The taxi industry is disgruntled over the municipality’s planned Rapid Bus System that is due to be implemented soon. “I will say that we got a cordial relationship but there are misunderstandings as you will have seen the taxi industry march because of the allegation that we are condemning their memorandum, which some we are beginning to clarify. “I will say that I don’t have any respiratory relationship with the taxi industry,” Masina told Radio 702. During the march last week, the taxi industry called for the removal of the mayor. They accused him of neglecting taxi drivers. The taxi operators are unhappy with the delay of the implementation of the Harambee Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system which they allege to have negatively impacted the economic growth of the taxi industry. Masina said that they will soon be able to pronounce on the progress of this programme. -TNA Reporter
