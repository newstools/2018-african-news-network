DEEMED a battle of the rallies in the run-up to Nelson Mandela Bay Metro’s motion of no confidence against mayor Athol Trollip, both the EFF and the DA will be hosting rallies a day before the motion is held. Trollip’s head is on the chopping block after the EFF threatened to throw him out and endorse former deputy minister of finance Mcebisi Jonas for mayor. The rally will be at the Vuyisile Mini Square outside the City Hall in Port Elizabeth tomorrow, while the EFF will also be holding a rally in Nelson Mandela Bay at the Nangoza Jebe Hall in New Brighton Hall. The motion of no confidence against Trollip and the coalition government is expected to take place tomorrow. “This is an opportunity for the people of Nelson Mandela Bay to raise their voices and make it clear that they don’t want the city handed back to the corrupt and ineffective ANC,” the DA said. Trollip, who is also contesting the federal chairship of the party, has been campaigning via the hashtag #TrollipForChair and tweeted that he and the party are ready for the motion.
He said the DA wasn’t afraid to be on the opposition benches. “As far as I’m concerned, I might be out of a job by Thursday. But I don’t care. I didn’t go into politics for myself. I got into it to fight for the values I believe in. It’s an honourable endeavour to build a South Africa for all South Africans,” Trollip tweeted. Trollip said being moved from the mayoral position doesn’t faze him, stating that for him being in politics wasn’t for any particular post. “There are some members of my mayoral committee who were MPs before becoming NMB councillors. They gave up comfortable positions with benefits to help me make this metro better.” -TNA Reporter
