National Treasury on Tuesday announced Mark Kingon as acting commissioner for the South African Revenue Service (Sars). This follows the suspension of current commissioner Tom Moyane with immediate effect, by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa said it was in the public interest to restore the credibility of Sars without delay. In a letter to Moyane, Ramaphosa said: “Developments at Sars under your leadership have resulted in a deterioration in public confidence in the institution and in public finances being compromised. For the sake of the country and the economy, this situation cannot be allowed to continue, or to worsen.” Treasury said Kingon had been with Sars since its establishment and worked his way through the ranks to become Group Executive for Relationship Management within business and individual taxes. Last week, Kingon stepped into the role of second-in-charge in an acting capacity when the chief officer for business and individual taxes Jonas Makwakwa resigned. -TNA Reporter
