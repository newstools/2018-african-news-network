Congress of the People (Cope) in the Blouberg municipality in Senwabarwana, Limpopo, has condemned leading retailers for selling rotten food to consumers. Cope leader in the region Tlouamma Ntshilo Martin said party officials had to force the management of Roots Butchery and Nizams Supermarket to remove food that was visibly rotten from their refrigerators. Martin said, as the party leadership in the area, they received complaints from residents about the stores selling rotten food. “We then acted on the residents complaints and visited the shops and found that indeed the retailers were selling food that was not up to standard,” Martin said. According to Martin, chicken products, red meat, soft drinks, butternut and viennas were removed from Roots Butchery while out of date soft drinks and margarine was removed from Nizams Supermarket. He said they then called municipality officials to come and witness what the residents were being fed. “The municipality officials then came in to see that the food was indeed not suitable for consumption. They then took all of it to a dumping site far from everyone. We can’t allow this. We are not pigs.” Martin said the employees in all stores confirmed that management knew about problems at the stores but did not want to address them. Attempts to get comment from both franchises were unsuccessful. -TNA Reporter
