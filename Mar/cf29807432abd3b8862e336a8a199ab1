Power utility Eskom has on Thursday been ordered to set aside the suspension of its former head of legal services Suzanne Daniels. In a ruling by the CCMA, Eskom was judged to have suspended Daniels unfairly. The utility’s former board took a decision to suspend her after she allegedly spent R50 000 on a team-building exercise. Eskom will now have to give the former legal services head five months remuneration by 30 April. The power utility has also been directed to place Daniels into her job by 19 March 2018. Since her departure from Eskom, Daniels has played a part in the ongoing Parliament committee investigating allegations of state capture at the utility. During her testimony at the commission last year, Daniels said she had attended a meeting with Deputy Public Enterprises Minister Ben Martins, Duduzane Zuma, Ajay Gupta, Salim Essa and a Chinese woman, whom she said she did not know the name of. She testified that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe’s legal wranglings regarding his contested R30 million pension payout. Martins flatly denied her claim Martins and announced that he will be taking legal action against her. –TNA Reporter
