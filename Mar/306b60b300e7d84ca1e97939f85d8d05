Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has described as baseless allegations by the ANC in Gauteng that he of flouted procurement processes by giving R11 million to NGO, the Field Band Foundation (FBF). According to the ANC, Mashaba initiated funding for FBF without any written proposal sent to the city by the foundation. “Mashaba was the chairperson of FBF for over 16 years. The FBF is a well-established NGO with support from the private sector and boasts a budget of R22 million per annum, yet Mashaba has the audacity to initiate funding of over R11 million from the rate-payers’ money to fund the FBF,” the ANC said in a statement. Mashaba however said the city’s involvement with FBF is a strategy to combat substance abuse, which in turn makes the partnership a central component in its efforts. “In October 2017, a meeting between the city of Johannesburg and FBF took place where the city was represented by the director in MMC Mpho Phalatse’s office. It is at this meeting where the FBF was informed about the decision of the September 2017 Special Mayoral Committee meeting to increase funding for the youth programme from R10.5 million to R11.1 million. The FBF was then requested to submit a revised proposal requesting R11.1 million,” Mashaba said in a statement. The mayor further said the city and the band held a discussion on its strategy to combat the scourge of drugs in February last year, adding that he suggested that Social Development look into the FBF. -TNA Reporter
