Lawyers representing the Gupta brothers have criticised the handling of Parliament’s ongoing Eskom inquiry, accusing politicians of grandstanding and humiliating witnesses. This comes as the brothers, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba and former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, were invited to attend the inquiry this week. “The questioning of witnesses is allowed in circumstances where the presiding officer appears to be completely unable and unwilling to ensure that the proceedings before the committee are conducted with any form of decorum or control. Witnesses are humiliated at the will of politicians,” reads part of a letter sent to parliament by lawyers representing the brothers. According to their lawyers, the brothers will not be appearing before parliament as they are all currently out of the country. African Christian Democratic Party MP Steve Swart had previously been sceptical of their appearance saying: “Hope springs eternal that they will appear next week” because the Guptas were said to be out of the country. Swart recommended that the Eskom inquiry gets a backup plan ready because “I can almost guarantee we won’t have the Guptas here next week. They are out of the country.” Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba who had previously requested a period of ten days to prepare himself adequately for his appearance began his testimony on Tuesday morning. -TNA Reporter
