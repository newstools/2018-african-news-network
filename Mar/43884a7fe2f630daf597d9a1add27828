EFF leader Julius Malema on Sunday said there was nothing that forced the party to vote for either a candidate from the ANC or DA in Nelson Mandela Bay. Malema said that the EFF was not choosing to support a candidate from the ANC because it trusted the ruling party. “The ANC and the DA are the same, the other one is racist, the other one is corrupt,” Malema said. Speaking at the Standard Bank Arena where the EFF launched its voter registration campaign on Sunday, Malema said the party had put forward the name of Mcebisi Jonas to be mayor in Port Elizabeth because he allegedly refused an R600 000 bribe from the controversial Gupta family. “We want a clean person to be the mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay. The ANC must know that if there is no Mcebisi Jonas, or anything that looks like Mcebisi Jonas, we are going to fold our hands.” Malema said that if the ANC refused on its demands, it would lose its vote but that vote would not go to the DA. “When we fold our hands, the DA wins, let the DA win in PE because the ANC brought the wrong candidate. But even if the DA wins in PE and Trollip becomes a mayor again, he must be a mayor not through our votes. Nothing forces us to vote for either of the two, we must never feel pressured or forced to vote for any of the two until they give a reason why we must vote for them.” The EFF has given the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay an ultimatum to either put the name of Mcebisi Jonas as the mayoral candidate or the EFF will not vote for them. This comes after the EFF decided on a motion of no confidence against DA Mayor Athol Trollip in the metro after the DA opposed the EFF’s expropriation of land without compensation motion in Parliament. “We have taken the decision to remove the mayor of PE. Some are asking why not yet and Mashaba, the mayor of DA in PE is a white man. We are touching them where it matters most! Trollip will not be a mayor after 6 April.” -TNA Reporter
