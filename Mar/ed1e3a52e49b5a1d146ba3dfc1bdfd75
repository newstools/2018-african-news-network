The sentencing of former Top Billing presenter Simba Mhere’s killer Preshalin Naidoo has on Friday been postponed to the 19-20 April. Naidoo made a brief appearance in the Randburg Magistrate Court where it was expected that he would hear his final fate. However, sentencing was remanded due to the unavailability of Naidoo’s probation officer who was meant to provide a report to the court. Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O’Bryan, died on the scene of a car accident on William Nicol Drive in Fourways, Johannesburg on January 31, 2015. In January Magistrate David Mahango found Naidoo guilty of two counts of culpable homicide and recklessly causing the death of the pair. During the trial, Naidoo had claimed that the crash was caused by a malfunction of his vehicle and he had denied consuming alcohol prior to the incident but the court ruled that his version was improbable. At the time of the accident, Mhere was driving to the airport with O’Bryan and his father, who survived the accident. -TNA Reporter
