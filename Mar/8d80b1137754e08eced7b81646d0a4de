Former Steinhoff executives, former CFO Ben la Grange and former CEO Markus Jooste have been given 10 days to appear before Parliament or face being served with a subpoena. This comes as both executives snubbed a scheduled appearance before a joint meeting
of the standing committee on finance, the standing committee on public accounts and the
portfolio committee on trade and industry, in Parliament on Wednesday. Earlier on Wednesday, a letter from La Grange’s legal representative confirmed that he would not be appearing before the committee while Jooste’s lawyers De Klerk and Van Gend said in a letter on Tuesday that because he had resigned as CEO of Steinhoff back in December, he would not be in a position to assist the committees. The three committees said in response that they would, in consultation with Parliament’s
Legal Service Unit, decide on Wednesday whether to subpoena Jooste and would inform the speaker’s office of their decision. On Wednesday, it was confirmed that Steinhoff attorney Robert Driman would make a presentation on the company’s behalf. Meanwhile, PWC Director Louis Strydom said that the firm had launched an investigation into allegations of fraud at Steinhoff. According to Strydom, they have thus far received full cooperation from other role players except Jooste, who has refused to be interviewed. Last year, Steinhoff International’s shares crashed after it revealed “accounting irregularities,” raising questions about corporate governance in South Africa. Meanwhile, MPs on Wednesday also called for R3 million bonuses paid to board members to be placed on hold until Steinhoffs AGM on 20 April. The DA has already slammed the move. “It is simply reckless that the same individuals who were running the company when financial reports were apparently manipulated are now being “rewarded” for fixing the mess they created,” DA MP Alf Lees said in a statement. -TNA Reporter
