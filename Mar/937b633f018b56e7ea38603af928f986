DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane has spoken out against Western Cape Premier Helen Zille’s offensive and insensitive tweet over the Esidimeni tragedy. Maimane was speaking during a Human Rights Day event at the Talisman Foundation at the Hill in Johannesburg, where the party unveiled a plaque in commemoration of the victims of the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Zille took to Twitter following the judgment by retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke, who ordered the Gauteng government to compensate the families of the Life Esidimeni tragedy R1.2m, with R1m for constitutional damages. Zille questioned what the families did to raise the alarm about their horrid conditions at these NGOs. “No I don’t support it,” Maimane said. A total of 144 mentally ill patients died after the execution of Gauteng health’s Mental Health Marathon project where patients were transferred from Life Esidimeni facilities into illegal NGOs. The DA’s Jack Bloom said the tragedy was far from over as there were 44 patients still missing. Zille’s tweet has been met with outrage. “The families of those who are left behind understand the pain they went through and when you surrender yourself to a mental health institution, often you find those families are left powerless in a context such as this one and so I stand with the families and say they should be supported,” Maimane said. -LERATO DIALE|leratod@thenewage.co.za
