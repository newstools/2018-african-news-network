Former National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Mxolisi Nxasana has told the Constitutional Court he wants his job back and is prepared to hand over a golden handshake given to him by former President Jacob Zuma. Nxasana and his successor Shaun Abrahams approached the Constitutional Court on Wednesday, seeking to overturn a North Gauteng High Court ruling against them. The court refused to accept Nxasana’s affidavit and ruled against him in a matter relating to his golden handshake and the call for his reinstatement and Abrahams’ appointment as his successor. It also set aside Abraham’s appointment as NPA head and instructed then Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint his successor. Nxasana left the NPA in 2015 after he was given a golden handshake of R17.3 million by Zuma after he previously announced that he would establish a commission of inquiry to look into Nxasana’s fitness to hold the office, which he subsequently abandoned. Nxasana’s lawyer Michelle le Roux told the court her client had made a mistake in accepting the golden handshake and he was prepared to return it. Le Roux was asked by Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga, if by accepting the golden handshake, Nxasana was not being an accessory to corruption. “This is simply not a bribe. This is a settlement of all these disputes… After every single door was closed in my client’s face,” le Roux said in response. Le Roux also conceded that the settlement reached was unlawful. “It is a common cause that settlement agreement was unlawful and must be set aside.” -TNA Reporter
