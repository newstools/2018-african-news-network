The Water and Sanitation Department says while Vaal Dam is full it will not be releasing any water. The Department’s spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said the dam reached its full capacity at a time when some provinces are experiencing severe water shortages. “We’re still in a very comfortable situation and don’t require us to actually do any releases as well as considering that we’re reaching the end of our rainy season. Earlier in the week, the department issued a statement regarding the major dams which form part of the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS), saying the recent downpours left dams in a healthy state. The IVRS recorded a considerable 6.3% increase, moving from 77.2% last week to 83.5% this week. The System was at 87.3% last year at the same time. The IVRS consists of 14 dams and is responsible for the supply of Sasol and Eskom and thus is the heartbeat of the economy of the province,” the department said in a statement. The Vaal dam was last this full last year round about the same time as this year. Ratau attributed the significant news to the recant rain that had been pouring in the past few days. -TNA Reporter
