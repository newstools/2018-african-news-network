The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) has ordered two training institutions, accused of not offering sufficient training to airport security trainees, to stop all training until an investigation has been completed. The SACAA on Tuesday said it took matters of safety and security very seriously and that it had launched an immediate investigation into the veracity of allegations made in news reports. On Monday, media reports emerged that Reshebile Aviation and Security Services sent its staff for week-long training at Ntate Aviation and Security Training but there was no instructor for them. Instead, they were made to watch a few videos and also read a theory book. The trainees are responsible for passengers’ luggage, weapons and other contraband before loading it onto planes. Authority spokesperson Kabelo Ledwaba said, upon receiving reports about the allegations, the SACAA immediately dispatched a team of inspectors to get evidence from the school. “We can confirm that the regulator advised the management of the school that no aviation security training should take place until the investigation is completed,” Ledwaba said. Ledwaba confirmed that Ntate Aviation and Security Training was accredited by the SACAA, however, this was subject to training being conducted in-line with the regulations at all times. He said the regulatory body would take about three weeks to conclude all its investigations and to go through all the evidence collected. “Depending on the outcome of the investigations, however, other processes may follow which may extend the period. “We wish to emphasise that the SACAA views these allegations in a serious light and will not tolerate any lowering of the standards, especially by training schools.” -TNA Reporter
