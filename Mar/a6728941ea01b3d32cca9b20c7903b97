The North Gauteng High Court has on Thursday struck off the roll an urgent interdict application which sought to prevent energy minister from signing 27 independent power producers (IPPs). The application was brought by trade union Numsa alongside lobby group Transform SA. On Tuesday, the groups asked the court to interdict Energy Minister Jeff Radebe and Eskom from concluding agreements IPPs until the court heard an application by the Coal Transporters Forum (CTF), which is already before the court on the issue and also to make submissions on the CTF case. Earlier this month, the two groups obtained an urgent court interdict stopping the signing of a contract between government, Eskom and the IPPs. Eskom has welcomed the news saying that they are merely an implementing agency on behalf of the government which is the one pushing for new players in the energy field. “Eskom will have to wait until the whole process is done but what we have indicated as a company is that we will fund these IPPs because we have already signed 64 of them. Those 64 are already producing 4000 Megawatts into the grid,” said Eskom Khulu Phasiwe following the ruling. Meanwhile, energy expert Chris Yelland has welcomed the news adding that government should in a few weeks make an announcement regarding the signing of agreements. “The Ipp costs Eskom nothing at all. No capital costs…any suggestion that this will put a strain on Eskom’s finances is not correct,” he said. Numsa had rejected the signing of the IPP agreements arguing that it was expensive. “Currently Eskom can produce electricity for 32 cents per kilowatt hour but the cost of procuring from IPPs is at a staggering R2,14 per kilowatt hour! This project will cost the fiscus more than R1.1 trillion over the next 20 years. “The IPP project will have a devastating impact on our economy and is likely to result in high electricity tariffs and that is why we reject it,” said Numsa Secretary General Irvin Jim. -TNA Reporter
