Thirteen people have died on Friday morning on the R33 outside Durban when a minibus taxi collided with a vehicle. KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) emergency spokesperson Robert Mckenzie confirmed the incident, saying that the preliminary information pointed to a collision between a minibus taxi and two other vehicles. He further said in another separate incident, at least 16 people have been injured on the R56, also involving a taxi, near Richmond. “The cause of the crashes is still unknown at this stage,” Mckenzie said. Meanwhile, Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesperson Simon Zwane says so far the KZN incident where 13 people died in a multiple car crash is the only one recorded but says they are collating information from other provinces. “The department has partnered with other stakeholders including taxi associations, bus company Putch, department of health and many others,” Zwane said. Last week Transport Minister Blade Nzimande launched the Easter Road Safety Campaign which aimed at increasing traffic police presence on the road and reduce fatalities. This included the activation of halfway stations that will give long-haul drivers the opportunity to rest in-between their destinations. -TNA Reporter
