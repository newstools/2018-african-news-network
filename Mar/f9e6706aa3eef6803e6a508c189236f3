The Gauteng Department of Health on Wednesday announced it had paid R17 billion to 7 513 suppliers from April 2017 to 19 March 2018. This comes after Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa established the Health Intervention Task Team (ITT) to tackle the financial woes faced by the department. “Tough economic conditions and the technical recession experienced in South Africa in 2017 were just some of the challenges it faced,” the department said. The ITT presented its recommendations to the Executive Council Lekgotla which was accepted and has since become the mandate of the department to implement. “This meant that a method had to be found of dealing and settling the large accrued liabilities that built over time. The Gauteng provincial treasury came on board and has made R4.8 billion available to settle accrued liabilities over the medium-term expenditure framework. R1.5 billion of these funds will be made available in the new financial year.” The projected accrued liabilities of the department stood at at least R7 billion as of 31 March 2018. “In the interest of saving small businesses, for most of whom the department is their biggest customer, the department has made an undertaking to settle all confirmed historic debt owed to these suppliers. These are suppliers that are owed R5 million and less.” -TNA Reporter
