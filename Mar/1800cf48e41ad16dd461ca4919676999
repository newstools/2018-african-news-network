The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa has welcomed the arrest of two suspects who were involved in the shooting of Captain Dumisani Mhlanzi at KwaMaphumulo last week. “We hope that the bold actions of these police officers will bring some closure to the family of Captain Mhlanzi. We are told that these men may be linked to many robberies that were committed in KwaZulu-Natal. “I need to commend the multidisciplinary approach employed by police in KZN that is ensuring that criminals are brought to book. Various police units working together with other policing agencies outside the SAPS as well as in the private sector are ensuring that criminal syndicates are dismantled,” said Langa. It is alleged that SAPS proceeded to a hostel block on Musa Road, KwaMashu were suspects opened fire on police officers and that resulted in three suspects being killed. Three firearms were recovered on the scene including the pistol belonging to Captain Mhlanzi. Captain Mhlanzi was laid to rest on Saturday. Police Minister General Bheki Cele speaking at the funeral service said that police must forget about human rights when they are dealing with dangerous criminals who put their lives at risk.
