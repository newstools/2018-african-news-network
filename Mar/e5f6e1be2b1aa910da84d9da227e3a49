Durban triathlete Mhlengi Gwala has suffered a severe injury after he was attacked by robbers while training in Durban Tuesday morning. Gwala’s friend Henri Schoeman took to Twitter to confirm the attack. A friend of mine, cycling in the Durban area was robbed by three people this morning, Then they attempted to saw off both legs with a chainsaw. Blade too blunt and only got half way through one and started on the other. Absolutely disgusting! How safe are we on SA roads? — Henri Schoeman (@H_Schoeman) March 6, 2018 Greg Stedman said Gwala was attacked by three people. Thinking and praying for Mhlengi Gwala who was attacked by three people while out riding this morning. Attackers took a chainsaw to his leg!
