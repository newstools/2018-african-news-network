Human Settlements Minister Nomaindiya Mfeketo will on Wednesday visit the Zwelihle township in Hermanus following protests by community members. Residents at the weekend reportedly went on the rampage, which resulted in a violent protest. On Monday, a stand-off with police took place after a group of residents marked out plots and marched to the municipal manager’s office, demanding the supply of water and electricity. A satellite police station was set alight, three SAPS vehicles were damaged and one member was injured in several run-ins between the police and community members. More police officers, comprising members from neighbouring stations, public order police and members of the K9 unit, deployed in the area to restore calm on Tuesday. Western Cape MEC for Human Settlements Bonginkosi Madikizela met with the community during a mass meeting on Tuesday to address residents’ issues. -TNA Reporter
