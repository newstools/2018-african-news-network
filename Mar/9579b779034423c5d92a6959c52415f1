ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule says that there is no reason to panic over the ruling party’s plans to expropriate land without compensation. Land has been expropriated without compensation in South Africa several times, he said at a media briefing in Cape Town yesterday. He also said that the ANC would hold a land workshop on April 20 and 21 to be followed by a land summit. “We will call a land summit that will involve all stakeholders. There is no need for any panic because in this country land has been expropriated without compensation several times,” Magashule said. “There has never been any problem when the apartheid government did that. The Constitution of South Africa as it stands does allow in certain instances land expropriation without compensation,” he said after a three-day NEC meeting that ended yesterday. Whatever the ANC did as a ruling party, he said, it would do it responsibly and in the interests of the country. He also said that the ANC was firmly focused on the general election, which he expected to be held in May next year. He ruled out an “early” election yesterday, saying that it was something which opposition parties had called for. Elections, he said, were a standing item on the ANC agenda. “When we are prepared for elections we get into a war room. “Elections are supposed to be taking place and the president will proclaim in May. We are preparing ourselves as the ANC to have such elections.” On support for people, such as former president Jacob Zuma who is due to face corruption charges, he said that the ANC was not against members showing solidarity with those accused as long as they did not do so in the party’s regalia. Zuma, who attended the NEC as an ex officio member, was also innocent until proven otherwise, he said. He said that a national general council was still on the agenda but that the ANC had other matters to attend to as well. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|news@thenewage.co.za
