The Free State provincial government on Tuesday said it had not yet finalised the budget for Wednesday’s ceremony which will usher in new Premier Sisi Ntombela. “We have not yet finalised the budget, where does the EFF get that sum? We are currently in a meeting finalising that. Once we’re done, we will be able to give an exact amount,” provincial spokesperson Setjhaba Maphalla said. The EFF issued a statement on Tuesday expressing its disappointment over a provincial government plan to spend an amount of R20 million for the inauguration of the new premier, as well as a farewell celebration for for former premier, now ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule. “The EFF in the Free State is disturbed and appalled to learn of the planned extravaganza that will take place tomorrow on 28 March, meant to usher in the new premier of the province and to bid farewell to the outgoing premier, now Secretary General of the ANC, Ace Magashule. “We have also been reliably informed of the instruction issued by Magashule himself, instructing all mayors and municipalities in the province to mobilise people and transport that will take hundreds of people to the stadium at a phenomenal cost of over R20 million to the provincial government, and this amount doesn’t even include the costs to be incurred by financially struggling municipalities in the province to transport thousands of EPWP and CWP volunteers and ANC members to the Free State Rugby Stadium for the event,” the EFF said in a statement. The EFF further said it was absurd for the government to spent such an amount of money which could be utilised to change the lives of the people of the Free State. The party further called on the Free Staters to stand against corruption and to exercise their constitutional power to punish the ANC at the polls in next year’s general elections. -TNA Reporter
