Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba on Wednesday noted with concern a video of a department official circulating on social media. The video shows the female official “multitasking” by carrying out her duties while devoted to her cellphone. The employee can be seen stamping on passport while hardly looking at the documents. The video has since received a lot of attention on social media with users criticising the level of customer service from government officials. Gigaba said he has requested that his department investigate. -TNA Reporter
