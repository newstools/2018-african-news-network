“We reject the increase in VAT to 15%. We reject it outright.” This was the message delivered to the doors of National Treasury on Tuesday by the DA. In a march led by DA leader Mmusi Maimane, opposition party members approached the National Treasury offices in Pretoria on Tuesday where a memorandum calling for the scrapping of the VAT increase was delivered. Last month, former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced the first increase in VAT in over 20 years, which is expected to rake in about R23 billion a year for the fiscus. Maimane said the protest against the VAT was based on a refusal to make the poorest citizens bail out the mistakes of the ruling ANC. “To those who say a VAT increase was the only way to make up the shortfall, I say: Rubbish! You haven’t even tried to look for ways to save enough,” Maimane said. According to the DA, an increase in VAT can be avoided if the government looks at alternative means to save costs. “The bitter irony of the ANC government’s budget is that the only significant cuts in spending were all made in areas that directly affect poor communities. By slashing the funding to provinces and municipalities for school infrastructure projects and human settlements programmes and by cutting 2000 personnel from the police service, it is only the poorest communities who will pay.” The DA also believes that by cutting the size of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Cabinet as well as foreign missions, the government could stand to save up to R112 billion. Maimane called newly appointed Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene to do away with the VAT increase. “The question is not whether it can be done. We have shown that the money is there. The question is whether you and President Ramaphosa and your colleagues in this “new dawn” government have the courage and the will to do the right thing. The ball is now in your court.” -TNA Reporter
