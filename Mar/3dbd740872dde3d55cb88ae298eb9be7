The Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane will stand for re-election as the party’s leader in the upcoming National Congress. This is after the party opened the nominations process for electing a new leadership of the party last week. The conference will take place in Tshwane in the first week of April. According to reports Maimane said he will contest the leadership position as he believes he has done well at the helm of the party. Meanwhile, Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga is set to contest Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Mayor Athol Trollip for party federal chairmanship position.
The federal chairperson position is currently occupied by James Selfe. According to reports, the contest is between two factions in the party which is the progressives and conservatives.
It is said that there is no clear majority support between the two candidates. However, Trollip is a party heavyweight and his fall maybe a step too far for a party with a massive white base. Party leader Mmusi Maimane rose to leadership position due to Trollip’s support. At the moment it is not yet known who Maimane will support, but KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakele Mncwango said he would lobby KZN to vote for Msimanga comes April 7. During his interview with Dispatchlive Mncwango said even though he would be lobbying the entire province to support Msimanga‚ members still had a choice to go for a different candidate. “We believe that the position of the federal executive chairperson‚ which is currently occupied by James Selfe should remain with Selfe. However‚ we believe that the position of the federal chairperson should change,” he told DispatchLIVE in an interview. The nominations for candidates is expected to be closed on Saturday the 17th. -TNA Reporter
