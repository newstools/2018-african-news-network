A 4-year-old boy is suspected to have started a fire that caused extensive damage to several flats at Everham Place in Westham, Phoenix on Friday morning. Upon arrival, paramedics found that the upper level of the home was engulfed in flames. It is alleged that the 4-year-old boy was seen playing with a box of matches in one of the bedrooms when the fire started. “Reaction Officers had to evacuate occupants from two flats which are attached to the burning home due to the flames and smoke spread through the building,” said ER24 in a statement. It was also said that a 58-year woman and her 4-month-old grandson were treated by paramedics for smoke inhalation on scene. Firemen are currently on scene and in the process of extinguishing the blaze. -TNA Reporter
