The DA in the Free State on Wednesday described a call by the provincial government, instructing all officials to leave their offices at 9am to attend the inauguration function of Premier Sisi Ntombela, as an indication of “big man” syndrome. DA leader in the provincial legislature Roy Jankielsohn said it was a pity that the newly appointed premier participated in such an arrogant and self-serving endeavour. “It is a real pity that Premier Ntombela would willingly participate in such an arrogant and self-serving endeavor, so early in her term. she is fast becoming a (Ace) Magashule mini-me. Her actions are at odds with her words, which is typical ANC behaviour.” “Premier Ntombela is merely carrying on where Magashule left off, which means that the people of the Free State will continue to be denied effective, responsive and transparent governance.” “That the provincial treasury will continue to be looted to enrich ANC cadres and cronies, that service delivery will continue to deteriorate and that economic opportunities will continue to be denied to hundreds of thousands of unemployed Free Staters,” Jankielsohn said. This comes after a letter from the director general’s office instructing all officials working in Mangaung to leave work at 9am on Wednesday to attend the farewell of former Premier Magashule and inauguration of Ntombela. -Sipho Jack
