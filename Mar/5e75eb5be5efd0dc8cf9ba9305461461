Convicted “racist” Vicki Momberg was on Wednesday sentenced to three years in prison, with one year suspended, by the Randburg Magistrate’s Court. The former estate agent was found guilty on four counts of crimen injuria in November last year following a video of her that went viral, where she was caught articulating racial language towards a black police officer. The Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday sentenced the former estate agent to three years in jail‚ with one year suspended, on a condition that she does not get convicted of a similar offence. This means that Momberg will effectively spend two years in prison. Momberg will become the first person in the country to be imprisoned for crimen injuria. The officer who received the insult was attempting to assist Momberg after she was a victim of a smash-and-grab incident in Johannesburg in 2016. Momberg hurled the k-word numerous times towards police officers and emergency service operators who had intervened to assist her. At the time of her sentencing, Momberg had expressed her dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system of the country. The Equality Court handed her an R100 000 fine as damages awarded to the victim, Constable Clement Mkhondo. She was also then ordered to undergo sensitivity training and to offer an apology for her racist actions. -TNA Reporter
