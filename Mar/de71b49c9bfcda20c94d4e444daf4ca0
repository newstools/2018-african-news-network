The case against controversial former Crime Intelligence officer Morris ‘Captain KGB’ Tshabalala has been postponed to Friday next week after his lawyers raised concerns about security. The case was postponed in order to give the prosecutors and Tshabalala’s lawyers an opportunity to talk about heightened security during his appearance. Tshabalala’s lawyer Annelene van der Heever complained about the heightened security during her client’s appearance in court. Van der Heever also asked why there was increased security during Wednesday’s appearance, unlike in all other appearances. “We counted at least 19 heavily armed officers. It has not been like this during previous appearances. Today, they are armed to the teeth,” van den Heerden told Magistrate Nicola Setshoege. Over the weekend, reports emerged that Tshabalala, who is an awaiting trial prisoner at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre in Pretoria, tried to commit suicide. Van den Heever also complained about the manner in which Tshabalala was treated by correctional officers on his way to court. “When he was brought to court, he was kept in the back of the truck like an animal. He has the right to be treated fairly.” Tshabalala is applying for bail for a second time “on new facts,” after his initial bail application was dismissed. He was arrested in December while visiting his parole officer in Pretoria and charged with theft and defrauding SAPS. Among other charges, Tshabalala allegedly defrauded Crime Intelligence’s secret slush fund of more than R500 000. Tshabalala is also accused of defrauding SAPS by falsely claiming that R470 000 was needed to pay for blinds and curtains at a safe house and allegedly taking more than R200 000 from it. He was fired from SAPS as a police officer and as a Crime Intelligence officer. -TNA Reporter
