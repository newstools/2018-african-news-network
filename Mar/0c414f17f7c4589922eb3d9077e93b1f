Former Eskom board chairperson Dr. Ben Ngubane has dismissed assertions made that the contractual wrangle which resulted in the disputed R30m pension payout to former CEO Brian Molefe was deliberately manufactured. Making his appearance before Parliament’s portfolio committee on public enterprises on Tuesday Ngubane, went head-to-head with DA MP Natasha Mazzone who said that the whole debacle was intended to be a “get rich quick scheme” meant to benefit the axed executive. “Then you must assume that all of us at Eskom are crooks and terrible people to think of such things. Why would we want to enrich Brian Molefe,” said Ngubane. The former board chair said that all they had attempted to achieve was deal with Molefe’s disgruntlement following a dispute regarding the status of his contract and pension payout. Last year Molefe was ordered to pay back an amount he received as part of a much-contested R30 million pension payout and also ordered to pay legal costs. He was given a 10-day deadline to pay back the money. Ngubane, who has consistently been a firm supporter of the former CEO and his tenure at the power utility once again lauded his performance at the helm of Eskom and Listed a set of achievements pioneered by him. However, Mazzone was having none of it and said that Molefe alongside a host of other executives at Eskom is to blame for running the utility to the ground as well as a number of downgrades and Eskom’s poor financial state. “You have to take ownership of state capture which took place at Eskom. State Capture has almost ruined our country. Piece by piece utilities were sold to the highest bidder,” she said. Meanwhile, Ngubane also rubbished claims previously made by former Mining Minister Ngoako Ramathlodi that he was pressured by Molefe and chairperson Ngubane to help Oakbay takeover Glencore’s coal mine in 2016. “I cannot understand how the minister came to this idea,” he said. -TNA Reporter
