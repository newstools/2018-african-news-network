THE Hawks have dismissed media reports of a probe into Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The reports claimed that the investigations related to the SARS’ high-risk investigation unit. The Hawks had been probing the former so-called “rogue” intelligence unit for supposedly taking part in illegal interceptions and spying. Hawks spokesperson Brig Hangwani Mulaudzi said the claims made in the media reports were false. “There are no investigations nor impending charges preferred against Minister Pravin Gordhan,” Mulaudzi said on Tuesday. He said the media reports were motivated by “personal agendas and a willing channel of anonymous mischievousness”. He however confirmed that former SARS officials Ivan Pillay, Johann van Loggerenberg and Andries Janse van Rensburg had been formerly charged in the matter. Mulaudzi said each official had been issued with a summons to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on April 9 on charges of corruption and contravention of the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act. “It is thus not true that the Hawks are gunning for Gordhan. “It is also not true that any official from the Hawks briefed the former minister of police, Fikile Mbalula, of any investigation against Gordhan nor provide him with any information detailing developments and so-called compelling evidence.” -TNA REPORTER|news@thenewage.co.za
