The Joint venture operations between South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) resulted in the arrest of a 63-year-old business owner for illegal power connection. The operation was conducted in Industria North by the two enforcement working side by side with the City’s Group Forensic and Investigation Services (GFIS). The aim of the operation was to curb the illegal connection under the theme Buya Mthetho. “It is alleged that the property owes the City over R490 000 for rates and services. Power supply to her property was disconnected on the 16th January 2018 by the City’s technicians. Yesterday when the Operation #BuyaMthetho team returned to the property, they found that the electricity to the property was illegally reconnected.” The city said the mayor had previously instructed the JMPD to monitor properties which have been visited as part of the operation to ensure that services are not illegally reconnected again. “Operation #BuyaMthetho is a joint operation between all key City departments and entities such as GFIS, JMPD, Environmental Health, Social Development, Infrastructure Services, the City’s legal department, and Development Planning to name but a few. “The operation’s main focus is to ensure city by-law are adhered to by all within the City and that the rule of law becomes the order of the day,” City mayor Herman Mashaba said. The mayor also encouraged people to report any theft, fraud and corruption activities through the city’s tip-off hotline. -TNA Reporter
