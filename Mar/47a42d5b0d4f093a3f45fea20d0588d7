Parliament’s portfolio committee on basic education on Thursday raised concern over the latest allegations of sexual assault at the hands of a police forensic investigator, at the AB Xuma Primary School in Soweto. The forensic investigator has been accused of sexually abusing girls, aged seven and eight, at the same school where he was investigating a case of sexual assault. The incident is said to have taken place on Monday when the investigator visited the victims at the school to prepare for a court appearance. The school was rocked by a sexual assault scandal in October when 87 pupils were reported to have been sexually abused by a scholar patroller. A 57-year-old man appeared in court last week. His case was postponed to 11 April. Committee Chairperson Nomalungo Gina said: “This is extremely worrying as these learners were being prepared for the trail in which they are to testify against a school patroller who allegedly sexually assaulted 55 learners.” The forensic officer has been withdrawn from the case with immediate effect and a sexual assault case opened against him by the parents at Orlando police station. “This must be condemned in the harshest possible terms. Our kids need to be safe in the school environment. The last thing the committee expected was for these young learners to be allegedly molested a second time at the hands of someone they trusted.” -TNA Reporter
