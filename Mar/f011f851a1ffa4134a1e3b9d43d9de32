Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip says the motion of no confidence brought against him, was based purely on race, not his capabilities to perform his duties. “It is clear that this is not about land but the race issue. They are taking issue with me because I am a white man,” Trollip said. He said the DA and other coalition partners were ready to debate the motions and engage them on issues, but they ended up wasting eight hours with disruptions. Trollip said opposition parties in the council chambers pushed ahead with what he called “populism and racial polarisation” and disruptions that led to the postponement of proceedings. He also took a swipe at UDM councillor Mongameli Bobani by accusing him of being a law unto himself. “It was clear today (Thursday) that councillor Mongameli Bobani of the UDM’s actions were appalling and disgraceful. What is clear is that Bobani is a law unto himself,” Trollip said. Early in the month, the EFF tabled the motion of no confidence in Trollip, saying that it’s their way of punishing Democratic Alliance (DA) for not backing its motion to have a section of the Constitution amended to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. While addressing his supporters at Nangoza Jebe Hall in New Brighton Julius Malema said Trollip must know that if his party has not pronounced on his departure as a mayor then he must rest assured that he will. Malema also said should they fail to remove him as a mayor they won’t stop until he’s gone. “We don’t stop. Tomorrow, we are going to attempt to remove Trollip and if we fail, we will come back again until we collapse him and teach him a lesson. We have taken a decision and there’s no retreat about it”. -TNA Reporter
