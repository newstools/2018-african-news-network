The DA will on Monday lay a complaint with Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Commissioner Zodwa Ntuli over alleged fraudulent B-BBEE certificates issued by a Gupta-linked company. A Gupta linked business is alleged to have used fraudulent B-BBEE documents in doing business with Eskom. The company, which has not been named by the DA, allegedly secured supplier contracts with the national electricity utility. The DA in a statement said the actions by the company, together with Eskom and B-BBEE Matric’s willingness to go ahead and accept these “may constitute criminal behavior” and as a result, calls for an urgent investigation. The party said Ntuli would be acting within her powers to probe the allegations. “The B-BBEE Commission is empowered, in terms of the B-BBEE Act 46 of 2013, to investigate complaints received on any matter concerning Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment,” the DA said. Last year, Gupta-owned company, Trillian, was instructed to pay back money to Eskom that was allegedly unlawfully paid to it. An amount of about R1.6 billion was reported to have been paid to Trillian and McKinsey in their dealing with Eskom. These payments were later found to have been unlawfully facilitated. -TNA Reporter
