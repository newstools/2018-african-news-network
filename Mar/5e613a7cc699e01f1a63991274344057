AfriForum Youth has welcomed the Equality Court’s ruling that the EFF member Luvuyo Menziwa is guilty of hate speech and incitement to violence. Following Menziwa’s Facebook post in 2016, explaining why he hates white people and called for their killing, the court ruled that he must apologise for his actions within five days. Menziwa has been instructed by the court to also do community service specifically in poor white communities. University of Pretoria former Student Council Chairperson Henrico Barnard laid a charge against Menziwa in 2016, following the post. “It is encouraging to see that political student leaders are not above the law. I want to emphasise that leaders should accept responsibility for their statements and not make themselves guilty of cheap politicking,” says Barnard. Head of AfriForum Youth Henk Maree said he welcomes the ruling because those who are guilty of hate speech and incitement to violence should be punished by the courts, regardless of their colour. “We, however, note that Menziwa’s punishment is not nearly as severe as that of Penny Sparrow even though his statement contained an element of violence. “Likewise, many media houses constantly focus on cases of so-called racism where white offenders are involved but in this case, where a black individual was found guilty of the same offence it was not covered,” said Maree. -TNA Reporter
