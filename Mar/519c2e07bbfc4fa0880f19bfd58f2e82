Metrorail Gauteng on Wednesday announced train services between Koedoespoort and Pienaarspoort stations in Pretoria had been suspended. Spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng said the decision to suspend the train service was due to violence, attacks on train drivers and damage to newly rolled out trains. “At least six new trains have been withdrawn because of vandalism. There were several trains that were vandalised, windscreens were shattered with stones,” Mofokeng said. Mofokeng also stated that 10 employees were attacked in less than a week, with the latest incident taking place on Tuesday at the Eerste Fabrieke station. “We cannot risk any other life, we cannot continue like this.” Metrorail said that there would be no alternative plans for commuters and commuters with valid tickets for the month or weekly tickets could claim refunds. Meanwhile, Acting Provincial Manager of Metrorail Gauteng Goodman Matampi said, “This senseless and barbaric behaviour of vandalising Metrorail assets and attacking personnel totally unacceptable. This is in our view pure criminality, and such lawlessness cannot be tolerated and is condemned in the strongest possible terms”. He added, “We will ensure that law enforcement agencies prosecute those perpetrators to bring an end to this wanton destruction of our assets. We are determined to throw the book at those found guilty of this criminality and will work for hand in hand with the prosecuting authorities to ensure that they are charged with willful destruction of public property and economic sabotage. It is regrettable that these acts of vandalism will inconvenience thousands of loyal train commuters who rely on this affordable mode of transport. These assets belong to the community and employees, thus it is equally their responsibility to ensure that they are well protected”. -TNA Reporter
