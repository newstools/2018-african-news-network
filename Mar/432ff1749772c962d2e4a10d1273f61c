Gauteng MEC for roads and transport Ismail Vadi on Thursday launched the “Gauteng on the Move” mobile app for all public transport modes. The launch forms part of the provincial government’s plan to gear up for the fourth industrial revolution and modernisation of public transport. During the launch, Vadi said his department needed to bridge the gap between the front runners and those who still needed to understand the fourth industrial revolution. “This launch is part of addressing the ever-increasing needs of people, especially those living in poverty,”  Vadi said. “We are living in a time of change. The government needs to look at society at large.” Vadi also touched the topic of meter taxi drivers, saying that some drivers had asked for help fighting crime, as they no longer get customers. Last week, the Department of Transport condemned violence in the public transport industry which resulted in the murder of Taxify driver Siyabonga Langelihle Ngcobo. Speaking during a media brief in Centurion on Friday, department spokesperson Ishmael Mnisi called on all public transport operators to desist from any acts of violence and intimidation. Ngcobo’s body was found in the boot of a burnt out Taxify Chevrolet Aveo near Unisa’s Sunnyside campus on Thursday last week. The officials visited the Ngcobo family in Centurion to offer government’s condolences and support. “We are not happy with the continued violence because it is robbing families of their loved ones and hence the message from the minister of condemnation of violence,” Mnisi said. -TNA Reporter
