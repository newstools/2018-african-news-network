Gauteng MECs for community safety and roads and transport will on Wednesday visit the family of murdered Taxify driver Siyabonga Langelihle Ngcobo. Ngcobo’s body was found in the boot of a burnt out Taxify Chevrolet Aveo near Unisa’s Sunnyside campus Thursday last week. The purpose of the visit is to offer the provincial government’s condolences and support to Ngcobo’s family, Ofentse Morwane, from the department of community safety, said. “Community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane and roads and transport MEC Ismail Vadi have condemned the brutal murder in the strongest possible terms and have called on law enforcement to leave no stone unturned in bringing the perpetrators to book,” Morwane said in a statement. Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said both the cause and motive behind the incident were still a subject of investigation. According to an eyewitness, the Taxify driver picked up a client in Arcadia before he was attacked by a group of meter taxi drivers. The witness (a Taxify operator) described the ordeal of trying to save their colleague who was set alight in the back of the car boot as painful. -TNA Reporter
