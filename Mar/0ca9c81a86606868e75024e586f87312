In a bid to keep clients and driver’s safe Uber South Africa has launched an Incident Response Team (IRT) call-back line. The call-back line has been in its test phase since December 2017. Uber said they hope that the application will provide riders with 24/7 access to speak to Uber’s Global Incident Response Team. “Riders already have access to a global network of customer support centres to provide 24/7 support for general queries all over the world which can be accessed through the app, now with the IRT call-back line, riders can submit a ticket for a critical safety incident or accident through the app. “Including their contact number and a short description of the event, the rider will then receive a call-back within a couple minutes from Uber’s Global Incident Response Team.” The intervention comes after brutal incidents of uber drivers and passengers were attacked by rival competitors in the taxi industry. Last year an Uber driver was shot dead at the Etwatwa off-ramp in Benoni. At the time an SMS allegedly used by uber drivers circulated on social media revealed that the victim’s body was found dumped near the N12 highway while a tracking device tracked his vehicle at the Chris Hani informal settlement a few minutes away. Uber senior manager said the agency was constantly looking for new ways of improving communication with their clients. “We have listened to the hundreds of thousands of riders using the Uber app in South Africa and they’ve expressed the need to be able to speak with our teams in the event of a critical safety-related issue. “While part of Uber’s commitment is to ensure rider safety, we strongly encourage riders to always first use the national emergency line (10111). With the introduction of the IRT call-back line, we are able to help riders speak with our dedicated IRT within minutes.” -TNA Reporter
