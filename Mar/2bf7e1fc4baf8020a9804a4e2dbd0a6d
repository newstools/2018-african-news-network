A raid at the home of journalist and author of the book The President’s Keepers, Jacques Pauw on Wednesday evening, was part of an ongoing investigation that started last year following the release of his book. This according to Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi. Mulaudzi said the investigation is based on preliminary information which suggested that Pauw may have violated the National Strategic Intelligence Act by publishing confidential information. “The raid relates to his book The President’s Keepers and alleged violation of the National Strategic Intelligence Act. Pauw is currently facing court action by the South African Revenue Service (Sars) which seeks to have him charged for contravening clauses in the Tax Administration Act,” Mulaudzi said. However, the veteran journalist has questioned the timing of the raid, saying that he believed there were high ranking police officers who were hell-bent on seeing him behind bars. “This also shows you that while there has been political change in the country, the old guard of the police remains. We should not celebrate President Cyril Ramaphosa before we know how he will change policing,” Pauw said. He also wanted to know why his house was raided. Pauw further said there was a general who sent officers to his home to raid it. “Somewhere in the upper echelons of the Hawks, there is a general who sent them to raid my home. Why? All they left with in the end were a few chapters which I wrote a long time ago. I don’t even know what they were looking for.” In his book, Pauw made reference to certain details relating to former President Jacob Zuma’s tax affairs. The book also revealed that Zuma was paid a R1 million a month salary for at least four months after he became president in 2009, by a company owned by controversial Durban businessman Roy Moodley. -TNA Reporter
