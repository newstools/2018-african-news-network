A man is expected to make an appearance in the Lebowakgomo Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for exhuming his mother’s body in the Dithabaneng village, Ga-Mphahlele. The 21-year-old reportedly went to the local cemetery in December, where he exhumed his mother’s body from her grave. On Monday, the man was seen moving around the village, carrying a human skull. The police were summoned immediately and the man was arrested. “On arrival, they found full human skeletal remains in the suspect’s house and arrested him,” police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. The real motive behind the incident is still not clear as police investigations continue. -TNA Reporter
