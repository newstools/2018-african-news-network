The push to make liquor advertising on television screens a thing of the past has kicked into second gear with the SABC briefing Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane on the proposal. The outcomes of the Cabinet meeting held yesterday, Mokonyane said that the Department of Communications, Department of Trade and Industry and National Treasury agreed to meet to discuss the seriousness of the proposal. She added that further discussions would have to highlight the impact on revenue such a proposal could ultimately have on the public broadcaster. “We must look at different ways to raise advertising revenue,” she said. The minister also confirmed that an agreement had yet to be reached between National Treasury and the SABC finance committee on how much advertising revenue could potentially be lost should the ban go ahead. “We will look into various other possibilities such as the SABC could raise advertising revenue from sports broadcasting licenses.” The Department of Trade and Industry has previously spearheaded the need to deal with the negative socio-economic effects of alcohol abuse. According to Minister Rob Davies, South African taxpayers fork out close to R37.9bn per annum in order to deal with the effects of alcohol abuse. The department has already proposed the National Liquor Amendment Bill which would bring into effect legislative changes such as increasing the legal drinking and purchase age from 18 to 21, restricting advertising and regulating trading hours. According to research, alcohol abuse is rife in the country with South Africans consuming up to 5 billion litres per year. About 60% of South Africans drink alcohol, which is also higher than the world average of 52%. On average between 10 and 12.4 litres of alcohol, compared to a global average of 6.2 litres, is downed per person in SA. -TNA Reporter
