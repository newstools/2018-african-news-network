The Democratic Alliance (DA) said it is concerned about South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) revelations in Parliament that grant beneficiaries will have to pay R10 in bank charges from 1 April. The DA said these charges will affect 5.4 million beneficiaries who are among the poorest and vulnerable in our society. The party was reacting to an announcement by Sassa in parliament that for the next three months, grant recipients will be charged for withdrawing money from ATMs and retailers. DA Shadow Minister of Social Development Bridget Masango said the reality was that for the millions of South Africans who live in poverty, R10 makes a huge difference. Masango said it is unfair for the poor to suffer because of the chronic mismanagement, poor planning, and instability at Sassa. “The truth is that if Sassa had its house in order the payment of social grants would have run smoothly. “Instead, we have a situation where there are constant chaos and confusion and a clear lack of decisive leadership,” Masango said. She said as the DA, they were reiterating their call for parliament to institute an urgent inquiry into governance issues at the agency as the new Social Development Minister Suzan Shabangu did not have a capacity to address the problems. “The chaos at Sassa can only be blamed on former Social Development Minister, Bathabile Dlamini, who constantly meddled in the affairs of the agency.” -TNA Reporter
