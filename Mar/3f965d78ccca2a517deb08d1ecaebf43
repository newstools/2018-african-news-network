Several Gupta-owned companies have approached the North Gauteng High Court to stop the Bank of Baroda from shutting down local operations. This is after the bank announced that it was in the process of closing its branch in the country. In October, the court ordered that the bank continue providing services to the companies, in order to prevent the loss of thousands of jobs. The companies have argued that if the bank closes and leaves the country, it will be in contempt of court. Through a statement, the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) said Bank of Baroda had notified the Office of the Registrar of Banks of its intention to close shop. “The Registrar is in discussions with the Bank of Baroda to ensure its orderly withdrawal from South Africa so that no depositor is disadvantaged,” the Sarb said. The application is expected to be heard on Thursday. -TNA Reporter
