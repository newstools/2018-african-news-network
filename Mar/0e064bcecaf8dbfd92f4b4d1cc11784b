Four suspects believed to be involved in a series of robberies have been arrested by the police on Wednesday. It is understood that the flying squad was patrolling the area earlier when officers spotted a grey BMW driving recklessly at Kayalami Corner Shopping Centre. Captain Granville Meyer said, “The police members made a u-turn and followed the suspects. The suspects, upon noticing the police, sped off and a chase ensued causing the suspects’ vehicle to crash at the corners of Woodmead and Waterfall Drive at Waterfall in Sandton.” He added, “the suspects attempted to run away however swift action by police resulted in four of them being arrested”.
