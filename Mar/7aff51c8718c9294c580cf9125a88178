Deputy President David Mabuza told members of the National Council Of Provinces (NCOP) that government does not have money to be spent on farewell parties. Mabuza said the country has a lot of problems and urged officials and leaders to act in the interests of the public. “You are correct to raise a concern about this matter of a farewell party where money is going to be spent. We don’t have money, we have a lot of problems.” Mabuza was responding to a question posed to him by an EFF member on the alleged R20m farewell bash the Free State provincial government made for ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule. On Tuesday provincial spokesperson Setjhaba Maphalla said they had not finalised the budget for the ceremony. “We have not yet finalised the budget, where does the EFF get that sum? We are currently in a meeting finalising that. Once we’re done, we will be able to give an exact amount.” The EFF issued a statement on Tuesday expressing its disappointment over a provincial government plan to spend an amount of R20 million for the inauguration of the new Free State premier, as well as a farewell celebration for former premier, now ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule. “The EFF in the Free State is disturbed and appalled to learn of the planned extravaganza that will take place tomorrow 28 March, meant to usher in the new premier of the province and to bid farewell to the outgoing premier, now Secretary General of the ANC, Ace Magashule.” Meanwhile, Mabuza told NCOP members that government will inquire from the provincial leadership regarding the party. He further said that Magashule would have survived without a party, adding that he also survived without one. “You can still survive without a party, am here and I didn’t have a party at home (Mpumalanga). We must use our resources sparingly.” -Sipho Jack
