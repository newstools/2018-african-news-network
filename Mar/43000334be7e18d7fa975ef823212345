The emergency services have on Friday issued a warning for motorists to avoid the road leading to Valhalla from the R55 following a huge sinkhole caused by the heavy rains that swallowed a vehicle.

KwaZulu-Natal MEC for cooperative governance and traditional affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube said the heavy rains battered parts of the northern areas of the province, with Umhlabuyalinga area yet to recover from the floods that occurred last month. “KZN has suffered immeasurable harm from lightning strikes which caused serious damage, especially in our rural communities,” Dube-Ncube said. The City of Johannesburg emergency management services said it had noted with concern the warnings from the weather service that heavy rainfall leading to localised flooding was expected in most parts of Johannesburg today. Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said they would remain on high alert to ensure they were able to effectively respond to any emergency which might occur anywhere in the city of Johannesburg. “The main focus will be our 189 informal settlements throughout the city since we know that these communities are the most vulnerable to flooding incidents.” -TNA Reporter
