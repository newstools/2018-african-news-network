DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprise Natasha Mazzone will today lay charges of Money Laundering against the Bank of Baroda. The charges will be laid at the Cape Town Police Station. The announcement follows the Organised Crime and Corruption Project (OCCRP) that the bank deliberately laundered money on behalf of the Gupta family. OCCRP in its report alleged that the bank officials deliberately suppressed employees’ reports of questionable Gupta-related transactions. It also said some Gupta transactions and deposits lacked required documentation, certain transactions had inconsistent or incorrect information and that the bank had made attempts to disguise the origins of the money. Bank of Baroda announced last month that it would be closing its operations in South Africa this month. Mazzone said given the involvement of the Gupta family in the state capture project, these allegations should, therefore, be thoroughly investigated. “It is for this reason that the DA will lay criminal charges against the Bank of Baroda in terms of Sections 29 and 52 of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) Act.” She said DA will ensure that if the bank did indeed knowingly assist the illicit flow of money from parastatals to Gupta accounts, they will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law. -TNA Reporter
