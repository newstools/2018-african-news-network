Former Gauteng Premier Mbhazima Shilowa on Tuesday said the ANC had adopted the EFF’s motion for land expropriation without compensation – but was not ready with steps to take in terms of the amendment of legislation. The EFF tabled the motion for land expropriation without compensation in the National Assembly in February, which was overwhelmingly adopted by other political parties, including the ANC and excluding the DA. The motion was brought by EFF leader Julius Malema. Shilowa said that the had ANC adopted the motion while it was not ready with proposals. Following the announcement, the ANC said that it was going to consult experts on the matter. The debate on land expropriation is believed to have led to recent incidents of land grabbing in Gauteng and Hermanus in the Western Cape. The EFF in Gauteng said the illegal occupation of land could be addressed if the implementation of the expropriation of land without compensation was fast-tracked. “The sooner land expropriation without compensation can be effected, so as land may be redistributed equally‚ the better‚” EFF provincial chairperson Mandisa Mashego reportedly said. Meanwhile, the ANC has assured that the implementation of the expropriation of land would be conducted in an orderly manner. -TNA Reporter
