The city of Joburg’s Department of economic development has dismissed the Director of Sustainable Employment Facilitation for contravening the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA). This is after the department found the former director guilty of dishonesty for authorised grant funding to a business of up to the value of R5 million that did not comply with section 67 of the MFMA. “This particular business had a pre-existing contract with the department that clearly stipulated all monies which the company was allowed to receive for services rendered. “The additional grant fell outside of this agreement. Added to this, recipients of City grants are required to produce financials, detailing how the money was spent. This did not happen,” the department said in a statement. According to the department when the director was asked to report and account on the matter he misled the investigation and team and was found to be evasive in his answers. The Chairman of the disciplinary hearing was also of the view that the employee did not illustrate remorse. “These factors combined, resulted in the committee recommending immediate termination of employment.” “The Department of Economic Development remains committed to ensuring that the residents of Johannesburg experience transparent government and value for the rates which they contribute to the city. “Corruption is not only a scourge, but it robs the city of its ability to provide services, particularly to the disadvantaged,” the department said. -TNA Reporter
