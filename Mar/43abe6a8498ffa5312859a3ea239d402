Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has on Friday confirmed that it will meet with Public Protector‚ Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane next week Tuesday in order for her “to explain public statements she has made in recent weeks”. According to the chairperson of the committee Dr. Mathole Motshekga the meeting was initially set down for early last month, but due to changes in the committee programme, the meeting was postponed. Motshekga added that Mkhwebane’s report on the Vrede Dairy Farm in the Free State has yet to be sent to Parliament. “I have since been inundated with calls as to when the committee will deal with this matter. The committee can finally confirm that the meeting has been set down for 06 March 2018 to engage Adv Mkhwebane on these matters. We take such matters seriously and we are aware of the great public interest in the matter,” he said. Mkhwebane has faced harsh criticism in recent times with the Democratic Alliance announcing that it will write to National Assembly Speaker, Baleka Mbete to call for removal proceedings against her to be initiated urgently. The EFF, which was one of the parties that endorsed her for the position has also changed its tune and has called on her to step down. The EFF has continuously called on Mkhwebane to leave office following a High Court judgment on the Absa-Bankorp matter. –TNA Reporter
