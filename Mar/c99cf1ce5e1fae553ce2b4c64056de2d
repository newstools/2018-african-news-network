Deputy President David Mabuza will on Wednesday have his maiden question and answer session in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). This will be Mabuza’s first session since he was appointed deputy president by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Mabuza last week made his debut in the National Assembly where he faced questions about his suitability for the post of deputy president from DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen and Agang SA member of Parliament Andries Tlouamma. He was also asked about political killings in Mpumalanga during his time as premier and investigations that did not seem to be making progress. Mabuza is expected to be asked about the ANC’s resolution on land expropriation without compensation and to explain how the government planned to cushion South Africans, especially the poor, from the 1% VAT increase announced by former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba during his budget speech. The session starts at 2pm. -TNA Reporter
