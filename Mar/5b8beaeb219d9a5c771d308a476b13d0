The DA has condemned EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu’s “violent” behaviour towards journalist Adrian de Kock at the Parliamentary Precinct in Cape Town on Wednesday and has strongly encouraged the Netwerk 24 reporters to lay criminal charges. DA shadow communications minister Phumzile Van Damme said the party’s Deputy Chief Whip Mike Waters would be reporting Shivambu to Parliament’s Ethics Committee for investigation and action. “Shivambu’s disgraceful behaviour is an indication of an aggressive attitude towards the media by the EFF,” Van Damme said. While disagreements may arise between political parties and the media from time to time, she said those disagreements should never result in violence – or using racially-divisive language. She added that the party believed a vibrant media is the cornerstone of any thriving democracy. “The DA will continue to fight for the protection of free media and independent reporting and we will oppose anyone who attempts to stifle media voices.” Meanwhile, Shivambu has released a statement on the incident.
