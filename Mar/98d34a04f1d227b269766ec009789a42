Sunnyside police in Pretoria are investigating a case of a murder following the discovery of remains of a man believed to be a Taxify driver. Police spokesperson captain Daniel Mavimbela said they can’t say whether the deceased was a taxi driver or not, but the remains are subject of their investigations. “Police are investigating a case of murder following the discovery of the remains of a man inside the boot of a burnt out Taxify Chevrolet Aveo near Unisa Sunnyside campus last night. Both the cause and motive behind the incident are still a subject of investigation.” According to an eyewitness, the Taxify driver picked up a client in Arcadia last night before he was attacked by a group of meter taxi drivers. The witness (a Taxify operator) described the ordeal of trying to save their colleague who was set alight in the back of the car boot as painful. Police are appealing to anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrators. -TNA Reporter
