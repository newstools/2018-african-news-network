THE ANC in the Eastern Cape has welcomed the offer by the EFF to back former finance minister Mcebisi Jonas as mayoral candidate for Nelson Mandela Bay. EFF leader Julius Malema made the offer after being angered by the DA’s refusal in Parliament this week to back a motion calling for a constitutional change to facilitate land expropriation without compensation. He said the EFF would table a motion of no-confidence in the DA’s Nelson Mandela mayor Athol Trollip on April 6. He followed this up by saying that the EFF would vote with the ANC once Trollip was voted out of office if Jonas was its mayoral candidate. “We want someone who has rejected R600m. The ANC has punished Mcebisi Jonas for rejecting R600m by not electing him in their confidence or appointing him as a minister now,” Malema said. Commenting yesterday, ANC’s provincial communications manager Gift Ngqondi said the ANC was very clear on the offer. “We welcome it. For the past one-anda-half years the ANC has approached different parties, including the EFF. We will not be against anything to unseat the DA, which is a racist and arrogant party.” Ngqondi said the ANC would wait for a formal approach from the EFF “to see how it’s done”. He said while Jonas was not a councillor, there would not a problem in getting him in as one and having him elected as the mayor. news@thenewage.co.za
