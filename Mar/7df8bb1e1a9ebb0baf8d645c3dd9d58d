The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) has on Friday welcomed the appointment of heads of Crime Intelligence, Detective Services, and Protection and Security Services. Through a statement, IPID executive director Robert McBride said it hoped that the newly-appointed officer will work together with the organisation in ensuring a successful crime-fighting. “We applaud the appointments of the Senior Officers announced… we look forward to working with them to put criminals in jail, where they belong.” On Thursday both National police Commissioner Khehla Sitole and Minister Bheki Cele announced the appointment of the senior police positions. During the press briefing, Cele said the appointments are aimed at advancing the police’s core mandate of fighting crime. He also said it was part of the Saps turnaround strategy to bring much-needed stability to key units. The fight against illegal activity requires a Crime Intelligence division that is focused and progressive. The need for the complete overhaul of that environment remains a priority for the new leadership. Equally, Detective Services needs re-engineering and repositioning in order to do justice to its core business of resolving the crime.” -TNA Reporter
