Zimbabwe is the latest African country to ban the importation of cold meat from South Africa following the Listeria outbreak, which resulted in the death of 180 patients. According to The Herald newspaper, the country’s Health and Child Welfare Minister Gerald Gwiji said Zimbabwe had already activated its surveillance teams to monitor the importation of such products into the country. The paper reportedly said the country had not experienced any cases of listeriosis. “What makes this outbreak significant for us is that we do import quite significant food items, particularly cold processed foods into Zimbabwe from South Africa,” the minister said. Meanwhile, South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu has urged processed food manufacturers Enterprise, Rainbow Chicken Tiger Brands to take responsibility for the outbreak of listeriosis alleged to have been traced by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases to their processed meat products. “The companies must, as part of their responsibility, intensify consumer awareness campaigns to educate the public about the disposal of contaminated products instead of opting for denial and rushing to preempt lawsuits,” Mahlangu said. He said more effort needed to be put into the Wash Your Hands campaign and ensuring that parents replaced the products with healthier and nutritious alternatives in lunch boxes that their children take to school. -TNA Reporter
