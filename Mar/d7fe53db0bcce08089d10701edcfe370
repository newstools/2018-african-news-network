The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) says sustainable mining through a partnership involving the industry and the communities is key to the country’s economic recovery. Sanco Spokesperson, Jabu Mahlangu said this should involve freeing resources which were tied to the alleged Gupta patronage and corruption network. He further said that the pledge to revive the business rescue process has given workers and host mining communities hope that mismanagement which was threatening continued mining operation will henceforth be dealt with decisively. “The process to review the mining charter must as part of radical socio-economic transformation lead to the implementation of Social Labour Plans that support local procurement, benefit enterprise and skill development for sustainable community development and job creation.” This is after Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe announced that government will be engaging stakeholders in the mining sector in order to save jobs. “Stakeholders in the industry have committed themselves to saving jobs. There’s a bigger buy-in for everybody to work together and save the mine.” Speaking in Mpumalanga on Thursday at Optimum coal mine Mantashe said the effort to engage role players was to ensure workers’ jobs are safeguarded. His visit followed a strike by workers over unpaid salaries in February. Optimum mine has been placed under business rescue after the Bank of Baroda’s decision to pull out of the country. The mine has also been taken to court by another mining company, Derko Mining and Exploration in an effort to have the mine liquidated. This is due to the R60-million the mine owes to service providers. The mine could also be shut down over its failure to operate a community water desalination plant, which is a requirement for its mining licence. Optimum supplies coal to power utility Eskom, a contract that has come under scrutiny for being awarded irregularly. -TNA Reporter
