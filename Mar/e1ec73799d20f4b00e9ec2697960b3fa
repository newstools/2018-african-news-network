The office of the Public Protector has on Monday announced that Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane last week met with Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo in order to share the record of the investigation into allegations of state capture. The meeting which the office of the Public Protector confirms that took place last week in Johannesburg comes ahead of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture which is expected to begin its work soon. “The record includes documentary evidence and transcripts of meetings and interviews, among other things. It has been packaged into 110 arch lever files and 17 boxes and shipped off to the Commission,” the PP’s office said in a statement. Preparations for the much-awaited probe into state capture are now seemingly at an advanced stage since former President Jacob Zuma appointed the commission at the top of the year. Earlier this month deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo announced the top six officials who would lead the inquiry alongside him. Former auditor-general and SA Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica) CEO Terrence Nombembe was appointed as the head of investigations while Dr Khotso de Wee will serve as the secretary of the commission. Advocate Paul Pretorius SC is the head of the commission’s legal team. The teams
of lawyers comprise of Isaac Vincent Maleka SC, Leah Gcabashe SC and Thandi Victoria Norman. Meanwhile, The ANC has called on its leaders and deployees to see it as their responsibility to fully cooperate with all efforts and legitimate actions seeking to eliminate all illegalities plaguing the country, and the party. -TNA Reporter
