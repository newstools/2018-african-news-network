WITS University graduates feature in two prominent productions dominating international cinemas and local theatres. Atandwa Kani stars as young King T’Chaka in the much talked about Black Panther which has amassed fans across the globe. Kani, who holds an honours degree in theatrical performance from Wits, dazzles in the Marvel movie as the younger version of his real-life father, John Kani, who plays the older King T’Chaka. Kani senior is also a member of the Wits council. During his student days Kani Jnr captivated audiences in the Wits Theatre, the training ground of the country’s leading artists. Local theatre-goers are equally enthralled by Wits talent featured in The Colour Purple. Three graduates from the Wits School of Arts and two academics are part of the play which has entranced South Africa since it opened at the Joburg Theatre. Lead actress Didintle Khunou plays Celie, an AfricanAmerican woman struggling against patriarchy and abuse. Lerato Mvelase, widely recognised from local TV screens, shows her multidimensional talent as Shug Avery, while Yamikani Mahaka-Phiri wins audience hearts with his portrayal of Harpo. Prof Sarah Roberts’ magic as the production designer brings it all together as does Stan Knight, renowned production manager. The musical is based on Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-nominated film starring Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey and later staged as a musical. US creators heaped praise on South Africa’s production of The Colour Purple. Last week, American composers Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray added to the scores of people that were mesmerised and blown away by the performance of the South African produced musical. The trio travelled from the US to see the performance of the highly acclaimed South African premiere production. “Loved it, loved it, loved it.
