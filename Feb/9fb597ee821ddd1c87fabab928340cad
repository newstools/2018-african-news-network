The ANC has welcome president Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to reshuffle his cabinet. Ramaphosa made the announcement of his new cabinet on Monday evening at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. “As the ANC, we particularly commend the President for having exercised this prerogative in consultation with the National Officials of the ANC and our Alliance Partners. Undoubtedly, this act of giving due regard to the resolutions of the African National Congress, in the exercise of the prerogative bestowed upon the President, lays a strong foundation for greater alignment and cooperation between the ANC and its cadres deployed in government,” said the ANC in the statement. “The ANC congratulates Deputy President-elect Comrade David Mabuza as well as all comrades appointed and intended to be appointed Ministers and Deputy Ministers. We assure them of the organisation’s support in the execution of their duties,” said ANC. -TNA Reporter
