A 42-year-old man is expected to appear in court for drug possession after he was arrested at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Wednesday last week. The man was apprehended in an intelligence-driven operation by an integrated multidisciplinary team. SAPS officials reportedly received a complaint from a Reshebile security officer about a passenger, a Seychelles national, who was about to board a flight. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel KD Mogale said: “While searching this particular passenger, the officer felt an unusual hardness on the passenger’s thighs. The passenger was moved to the searching area where objects on his thighs were revealed.” “The two hard objects were discovered to be white and rock-like, wrapped with cellotape. Inside the plastic was what was suspected to be drugs.” It was found that the substance inside the plastic was heroin with an estimated street value of R112 000. -TNA Reporter
