National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete has dismissed the EFF’s call to have a sitting ahead of next week’s State of the Nation Address (Sona), to discuss a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma. The Sona will take place on Thursday, 8 February. Mbete and presiding officers in Parliament held a briefing on Thursday on the House’s readiness ahead of the Sona. The EFF had written to Parliament requesting a sitting ahead of the Sona. “The answer is no. We are not going to have a special sitting of Parliament before Sona,” Mbete said. The speaker also revealed that this year, over 1200 guests had been invited from across the world. On Wednesday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane announced that he had also written to Mbete. He requested that the Sona be postponed until Zuma had been removed from office and  Parliament had elected a new president. This year’s Sona also comes in the midst of the worst water shortage to have ever hit the Western Cape. Deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said authorities had planned for any water cuts that may hit the parliamentary precinct next Thursday. “There won’t be any water shortages during Sona. We have made contingency plans with the city of Cape Town to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Tsenoli said. Mbete also mentioned that R4.23 million had been budgeted for this year’s Sona but they were hoping to spend less. Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said they had received 1066 applications from journalists to cover this year’s Sona. “We have noted all the applications but it is impossible to accommodate everyone in the National Assembly press gallery. The gallery can only hold 66 journalists at a time.” -TNA Reporter
