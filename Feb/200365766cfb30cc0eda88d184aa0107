The police in Pretoria on Wednesday warned residents and visitors to Sunnyside to refrain from illegal activity. This after the arrest of 20 suspects during a crime prevention operation this week. The suspects were arrested for malicious damage to property, shoplifting, theft, possession of drugs and robbery. The police in area said SAPS officials would will not spare the rod for those who ignored the law. Sunnyside police station spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the most hideous of the reported crimes involved a 40-year-old man, nabbed on Tuesday, for allegedly robbing a 19-year old teenager of his cellphone. “The police also arrested a 56-year-old man at the scene of a motorcycle collision for intoxication,” Mavimbela said. Meanwhile, in separate incidents, a 50-year-old man and three others were arrested for possession of dagga. All the suspects are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court after they have been charged. “Members of the public should be cautious while operating their cellphones in public and suspicious persons hanging around, frequenting neighbourhoods should be reported to the police for intervention because others could be drug dealers, robbers or thieves.” -TNA Reporter
