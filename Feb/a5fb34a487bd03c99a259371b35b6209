The Black Business Council (BBC) has on Tuesday congratulated President Cyril Ramaphosa for reshuffling his Cabinet. Ramaphosa made the announcement of his new Cabinet on Monday evening at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. “We welcome the announcement of the changes effected by the president as it indicates the seriousness in which the president is dealing with corruption. It also sends a clear message of stabilising our economy to return to growth that will reduce the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality,” BBC Secretary-General George Sebulela said. The BBC is concerned about the retainment of former Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and former Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane in the new Cabinet. It said the duo did not fulfill their duties and responsibilities diligently as per their mandate in their previous Cabinet positions. The BBC said former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba should have been axed from the Cabinet, especially with allegations against him contained in the state capture report. “We would have expected that Malusi Gigaba rather be given the opportunity to deal with the dark cloud over his head and allow him to clear his name,” BBC CEO Kganki Matabane said. “Through these changes, we hope and trust that Radical Economic Transformation shall be accelerated and implemented. The time for talk should end and a new dawn of implementation should be born.” -TNA Reporter
