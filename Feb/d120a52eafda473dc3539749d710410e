Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Francois Beukman says it is sad that police officers die during the course of performing their duty. This comes after three police officers attached to the North West Tracing Team were involved in an accident outside eNgcobo on Tuesday morning. It is reported that the officers were on their way to the Eastern Cape area from the North West to help boost the Ngcobo killings police task team. “The passing of these officers robs the South African Police Services of the dedicated officials that are on a daily basis faced with danger while protecting our people. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families at this difficult time,” Beukman said. Police spokesperson Captain Khaya Tonjeni said the police officers were driving from Mthatha to Ngcobo to join the task team investigating the Ngcobo attack when their vehicle collided with a stray horse. A case of culpable homicide has been opened. -TNA Reporter
