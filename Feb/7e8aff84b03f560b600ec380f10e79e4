The DA has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to remove Energy Minister David Mahlobo in the event of a Cabinet reshuffle. DA Shadow energy minister and member of Parliament Gavin Davis said it was quite clear that the “new dawn” promised by Ramaphosa could not proceed with Mahlobo in his Cabinet. “Mahlobo refused to agree with Ramaphosa who, at Davos, said that we could not afford to build any new nuclear power station,” Davis said. Davis said Mahlobo had maintained that the procurement of nuclear energy was an integral part of the energy mix going forward and that the new Integrated Resource Plan approved by Cabinet reflected that. “At the energy portfolio committee, Mahlobo sent out a clear signal that he remains committed to the nuclear deal, rejecting studies carried out by the CSIR and Eskom that found that the building of a new nuclear power station would be expensive and superfluous.” The DA said the president needed to reshuffle Mahlobo out of his Cabinet as soon as possible. “This will open the door to reconsidering the IRP approved by former President Jacob Zuma’s Cabinet and shut the door on the corrupt nuclear deal once and for all.” -TNA Reporter
