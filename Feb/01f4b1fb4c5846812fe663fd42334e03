The DA said it is concerned about a reply to their parliamentary question that has revealed that there are currently 57 SAPS members working at the Family Violence, Child Protection and sexual offences units who have criminal records. DA Shadow Minister of Police Zakhele Mbhele said they are calling on Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to urgently brief the Portfolio Committee on how he intends to root out these members whose crimes include at least 3 cases of culpable homicide, 7 of common assault, 2 of assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm, and 1 instance of pointing a firearm. Mbhele said other crimes indicate a conviction for driving under the influence, reckless or negligent driving, fraud, loss of firearms and defeating the ends of justice and theft. “These are patently not the kind of people who should be working with children or the victims of domestic or sexual violence.” “It is quite clear from the questionable conduct of these members that they cannot be entrusted with the responsibility of addressing the extremely high levels of violence against women and children,” Mbhele said. Mbhele said the DA having police members with a criminal record is an indictment on both Mbalula and the entire SAPS leadership. -TNA Reporter
