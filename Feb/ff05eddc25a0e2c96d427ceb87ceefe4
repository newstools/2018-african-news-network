Parliaments Mineral Resources committee chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo has likened the ongoing wage strike at the Optimum coal mine in Mpumalanga to the infamous Aurora mine disaster. This comes as workers who downed tools on Wednesday still remain unpaid following the announcement that the Gupta-owned mines main banker is leaving the country. “It cannot be allowed under this government dispensation that workers are made to bear the brunt, while the owners walk away unscathed,” Luzipo said. Striking workers have been concerned about whether they are going to be paid on Friday, given that the company owes many of its service providers millions of rands. The committee added that it is not convinced by explanations given to the workers by Optimum mine for non-payment of salaries. On Thursday Eskom confirmed that Optimum has officially been placed under “business rescue”. The power utility also revealed that Optimum had failed to deliver coal to Hendrina power station in January leading to a penalty, which exceeds the mining company’s invoice from the company. The Mineral resources committee has now called on the Department of Mineral Resources to intervene with regard to the future of the mine and ensuring that workers are paid. Back in 2009 more than 5 000 jobs were lost at Aurora mine when Zondwa Mandela, Thulani Ngubane, Sulliman Bhana and his son, Fazel and board chairperson Khulubuse Zuma took over the mine. -TNA Reporter
