Civil Society organisations and political formations have vowed to intensify the fight against Former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s announcement of a 1% VAT increase. During his budget speech last week, Gigaba announced a 1% increase in VAT as one of the methods that will be used to generate income. 36 civil society organisations consisting of Section 27, Institute of Economic Justice, Public Service Accountability Monitor, Studies in Poverty and Inequality Institute amongst others said a reconsideration of the tax regime was not something to be taken lightly that national treasury can unilaterally decide on. The organisations called on the Treasury to present its evidence that would indicate VAT would have a limited impact on the poor. So far, more than 54 000 people have signed a petition on advocacy website amandla.mobi calling for the increase to be scrubbed. On Saturday, DA launched a petition in Soshanguve against the announced increase calling it an assault on the poor. Maimane said the party will also make sure that they oppose the move to increase it when the time for parliament to deliberate on it comes. Trade unions, Saftu and Cosatu also expressed their disappointment. Saftu threatened to go on a full strike to express their dissatisfaction with the announcement. NUM also expressed its anger at Gigaba’s decision during his budget speech that VAT would increase from 14% to 15% from April 1. On Monday, SACP Secretary-General Blade Nzimande said the macroeconomic impact of the VAT hike will dampen demand, impact on GDP growth and affect job creation. Deputy Secretary-General Solly Mapaila said they will make sure the decision is reversed as it will impact on the poor. “That is why we will campaign so that in the next term, this decision is reversed,” Mapaila said. -TNA Reporter
