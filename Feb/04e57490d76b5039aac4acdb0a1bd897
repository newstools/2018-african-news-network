A WOMAN, 22, died at a private game lodge at Hammanskraal after being attacked by a lioness yesterday. Netcare spokesperson Nick Dollman said the attack happened around midday when the woman was leaving the lodge. “We are not sure of how long the victim had been at the lodge for, but when the lady was attacked by the lioness, they were a few kilometres from the exit gate,” Dollman said. He said the woman had visited a farm in the Dinokeng Game Reserve. “When Netcare 911 paramedics arrived at the scene, bystanders were initiating CPR. Tragically, the victim sustained severe injuries and died at the scene. Documentation pertaining to her death was completed by Netcare 911 and handed over to the authorities at the scene,” he said. Dinokeng Game Reserve is a major attraction in Hammanskraal which is the first free-roaming Big 5 residential game reserve in the Gauteng region. Spokesperson Const Connie Mohamedi said police have launched an investigation regarding the matter. “It is understood that the woman was walking to the car with her friend when the animal attacked her.” charloteh@thenewage.co.za
