The ANC has welcomed the postponement of the State of the Nation Address (Sona) by National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete. President Jacob Zuma was set to deliver Sona on Thursday in Parliament, Cape Town. Mbete said Parliament was planning to write to Zuma to postpone his address, only to find out that the president was already doing the same. “The African National Congress notes and respects the decision of the president of the Republic of South Africa in consultation with the presiding officers of Parliament to postpone the joint sitting of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces; intended for the tabling of the Sona.” “We understand that this decision was arrived at based on a shared understanding that there is a need to deliver this important address in a conducive political environment,” the ANC said in a statement. The postponement of Sona comes after opposition parties met with Mbete requesting that she table a motion of no confidence against Zuma before Thursday. There have been growing calls from opposition parties and within the ANC for Zuma to step down. The ANC NEC will meet on Wednesday to discuss the future of Zuma and the preparations for Sona. -TNA Reporter
