The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is investigating whether excessive force was used in the killing of seven alleged cop killers in eNgcobo in the Eastern Cape. On Friday, seven people, alleged to be members of Seven Angels Ministry, were shot and killed while 10 members of the church and a police officer are recovering in hospital after they were injured in the exchange of gunfire while the police were raiding the church. On Wednesday last week, five police officers and a retired SANDF member where shot and killed when an unknown number of gun-wielding men entered eNgcobo police station and started firing randomly at police officers. Two more people were also shot dead, not far from the police station. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the organisation automatically becomes involved when police are involved in a case. Dlamini said the organisation’s investigation is in line with the Ipid Act that comes into effect when death occurs as a result of police involvement. Meanwhile, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said the police had no choice but to return fire when they came under fire from members of the church. Mbalula praised SAPS officers for their work in bringing the alleged perpetrators to book.
