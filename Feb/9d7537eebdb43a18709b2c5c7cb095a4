It is time for young people. We are available for advisory roles. Not cabinet.

During the Sona, Ramaphosa hinted at creating a smaller Cabinet. “It is critical that the structure and size of the state is optimally suited to meet the needs of the people and ensure the most efficient allocation of public resources. We will, therefore, initiate a process to review the configuration, number and size of national government departments,” Ramaphosa said. However, Mboweni, who was elected into the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the ANC during its 54th National Elective Conference in December, said he would not be minister but was available to serve as an advisor. “You cannot recycle the same people all over again. It is time for young people. We are available for advisory roles. Not Cabinet. We have done that,” Mboweni said. -TNA Reporter
