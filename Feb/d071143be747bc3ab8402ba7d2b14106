Cosatu has welcomed the ANC National Executive Committee’s (NEC) decision to recall Jacob Zuma as the President of South Africa. Following the ANC Secretary General’s announcement, the federation said Zuma has divided and humiliated the ANC on a number of occasions. Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said the federation has noted that the president has refused to abide by the decision of the NEC and resign. “We are not at all surprised by this level of intransigence and total inebriation with power by Zuma.” He added that this is, after all, a president who converted his cabinet into a rent-seeking, docile and unaccountable caste. “The ANC under his leadership has behaved like a fanatical cult.” Pamla said that while the idea of not humiliating him was gracious from the new leadership, the time has arrived for the ANC to stop this undistinguished political theatre and put the country first. “We call on them to recall Zuma using parliamentary processes and if it means supporting the motion of no confidence that was tabled by the EFF, so be it.” Cosatu also urges the ANC to explore the possibility of charging Zuma and subjecting him to a disciplinary process for defying a constitutional structure of the ANC and bringing the organisation into disrepute. -TNA Reporter
