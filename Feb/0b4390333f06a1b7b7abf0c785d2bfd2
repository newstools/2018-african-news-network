FOLLOWING a social media storm caused by Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, the South African Policing Union (Sapu) yesterday said it had accepted his apology and wanted to continue the cordial relationship with him. This was not the first time Mbalula has made headlines over something he has posted on Twitter. In the latest incident, he announced earlier this week that two police station commanders on the West Rand in Gauteng had been replaced. Sapu on Tuesday said Mbalula was “overlapping in his job and defamed the committed senior officers”. “Our relationship with Mbalula has always been cordial and the only problem we had was his announcement relating to the West Rand station commanders as we did not expect what he said,” Sapu president Mpho Kwinika said. Sapu on Tuesday gave Mbalula 24 hours to retract his statement or face litigation. Attempts to get hold of Mbalula’s office proved unsuccessful. However, media reports state that Mbalula apologised in a statement and said the tweet was taken out of context and was written by a junior staff member. Kwinika acknowledged Mbalula’s apology but said he was not entirely happy with it. Regarding the status of the concerned officers and whether they were back at work, Kwinika said they remained in limbo. refilwem@thenewage.co.za -REFILWE MAGASHULE
