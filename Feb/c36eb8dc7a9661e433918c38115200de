The Thabo Mbeki Foundation has on Tuesday welcomed the long-anticipated President Jacob Zuma’s recall. The decision was announced by ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule. “We, therefore, welcome the decision announced today by the National Executive Committee of the governing party, the ANC, to recall Mr. Zuma as a deployee of the ANC in his capacity as President of the Republic,” the Foundation said in a statement. Zuma’s recall comes after several meetings held by the ANC top six to decide on the president’s future. It is alleged that Zuma faces the possibility of prosecution for alleged criminal offences and corruption of various state bodies like State-Owned Enterprises [SOEs], the National Prosecuting Authority, State Capture and serious economic mismanagement. The current country president is expected to communicate with National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete to tender in his resignation as the president of the republic. “This long-overdue resolution by the NEC of the African National Congress gives the possibility for the ANC as the governing party to urgently and immediately attend to the many challenges and negative developments which have arisen during the years of the Presidency of Mr Zuma,” the Foundation said. -ANN7 REPORTER
