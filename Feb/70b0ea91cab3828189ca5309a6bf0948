The ANC is holding a two-day National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting at the St George Hotel in Irene‚ Pretoria. This is the first official meeting following the resignation of former state and ANC President Jacob Zuma earlier in the month. The meeting is being held amid speculation of a Cabinet reshuffle following Zuma’s resignation and the appointment of Cyril Ramaphosa as state president. The media has speculated, among other names, that current Deputy President of the ANC David Mabuza, who was elected deputy president of the party at the 54th National Conference in 2017, is one of the contenders for the post as deputy president of South Africa. Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, who also competed with Ramaphosa for the ANC presidency, has also been speculated as a contender for the deputy president post. Calls from opposition parties have also mounted for Ramaphosa to do a Cabinet reshuffle and appoint new ministers. However, the ANC has not confirmed talks of a Cabinet reshuffle or the position of the deputy president. -TNA Reporter
