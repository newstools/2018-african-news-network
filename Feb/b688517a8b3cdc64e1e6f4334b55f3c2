A 30-year-old woman will remain in police custody until 1 March on a charge of murder after making a brief appearance in the Zeerust Magistrate’s Court in the North West on Wednesday. The woman is accused of poisoning her one-year-old child. It is alleged that the woman, who was struggling financially, gave her daughter poison known as “Galepirimi”. The baby was then rushed to a local hospital where she was declared dead. Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said: “The mother allegedly disclosed that she poisoned the baby. A case of murder was ultimately opened and the mother was arrested.” North West police commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane has condemned the incident and urged members of the community to report their challenges to professionals like social workers, to avoid situations like this one. -TNA Reporter
