Amcu has expressed concern over 900 mineworkers who are trapped underground at the Sibyane Gold Beatrix Mine in the Free State. The union has called on Sibanye Stillwater to mobilise all resources to rescue the workers as soon as possible. Amcu said it received a report of a power outage from the mine after a heavy storm which led to 940 workers being trapped underground at Shaft 2 and Shaft 3. However, 40 workers were rescued while 900 remain trapped underground. “Amcu views this incident as extreme due to the sheer number of workers involved. It is common cause that lives might already be threatened due to dehydration and blood sugar issues because of lack of nutrition. “It is also common for adults to be on chronic medication and it is highly probable that there are some workers who are trapped without access to their medicine.” Amcu said the mine should have its own backup generator to avoid putting the lives of the workers at danger. This comes after the mine said it is attempting to borrow a generator from Harmony. -TNA Reporter
