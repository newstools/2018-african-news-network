THE Chamber of Mines said yesterday that, following the state of the nation address on Friday and subsequent engagement with the Presidency, it, on behalf of its members, had agreed jointly with the Department of Mineral Resources to postpone its court application in respect of the reviewed mining charter. The matter was due to be heard in the High Court from today to Wednesday. “The Presidency has said that the president is committed to resolving the impasse over the mining charter and to facilitate a process of developing a new mining charter, inclusive of all stakeholders and in the interests of the industry and the country as a whole,” the chamber said in a statement yesterday. “In line with the spirit and the tone of the message as stated by the president during the state of the nation address, the Chamber of Mines is agreeable to the request by the Presidency to give negotiations a chance. “The chamber wishes to reiterate its position that only a negotiated mining charter taking on board the views and inputs of all key stakeholders will enjoy the support and endorsement of all stakeholders.” Chamber of Mines president, Mxolisi Mgojo, said: “We welcome the president’s intervention and his commitment to engaging meaningfully with stakeholders in the industry – and others – on a new mining charter. Ultimately, a new mining charter must be developed and resolved through negotiation, with representation by a broad range of stakeholders – government, business, labour and communities. “For the chamber and the industry, legal recourse was always a last resort, intended to get the parties to the table, and the sooner we do that the better for the industry and our country.” Friends of the court the National Union of Mineworkers and Solidarity and the other applicants, represented by the Centre for Applied Legal Studies and the Lawyers for Human Rights, have been advised of this development, the chamber said. – 701068
