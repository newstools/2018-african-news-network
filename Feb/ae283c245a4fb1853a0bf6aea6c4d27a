Four people have been granted R5 000 bail by the Nelspruit Regional Court after they were arrested for defrauding Eskom. David Mthethwa and his wife Boniswa, Mwabisa Ngxoba, who is employed by Eskom as an admin clerk and Cinderella Moropane, who is employed by Eskom as work-coordinator, were arrested by members of the Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit. They have been charged with fraud and money laundering. It is alleged that the two suppliers, Mr and Mrs Mthethwa, who had previously been granted a tender to do live work services, had failed to renew their supplier authorisation certificate and their contract was supposed to have been terminated. Police spokesperson Leonard Hlathi said the suppliers were approached by the two Eskom officials and told that they were still in the company’s database and therefore should submit invoices, even though they were not doing any work. “The suppliers submitted the invoices totalling an amount of R2.9 million, which was paid into the supplier’s bank account and was distributed to different account numbers,” Hlathi said. The four will appear in court again on 29 March. -TNA Reporter
