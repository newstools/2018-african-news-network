Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng on Tuesday sent a stern warning to newly appointed ministers and deputy ministers sworn in following a Cabinet reshuffle by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday. Speaking during the swearing-in ceremony, Mogoeng strongly cautioned the ministers to not to take the oath as a mere show. “I will be failing in my duty if, given our history, I don’t underscore the significance of an oath of office. We are not here for a photo shoot. We can’t travel all this long just to come and gather and undertake an insignificant task. Everybody who is going to be called upon to take an oath or an affirmation is required to do so as allegiance to the Republic and obedience to the Constitution,” Mogoeng said. The chief justice said ministers, deputy ministers and newly appointed Deputy President David Mabuza has now entered into a contract with the Republic of South Africa. “So, if you like, you have come to enter into a formal contract with the people of South Africa. This oath or affirmation is going to judge you before the public does so. We cannot ritualistically gather here and read out this [oath] as if it was inconsequential, it exists because there’s good reason for its existence.” The chief justice said that the ministers were expected to be people who had “credibility and integrity” to serve the nation, “so may we all be warned”. Mogoeng said this was not just about assuming power. “… so that you can look important, it is to become a servant and may the oath judge most brutally, any of us who is here for a show. Or any of us who will betray the constitutional aspirations of the people of South Africa after the oath.” -TNA Reporter
