The bail hearing in the case against Cebolenkosi Gift Philani Ntuli will be heard on 7 and 8 March. The 29-year-old accused of killing Siam Lee made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Ntuli was arrested at his home in Hillcrest last month after an intensive investigation by the police. Lee, 20, was reported missing at the Durban North police station on 4 January. Her burnt body was found a few days later, in a sugarcane field in New Hanover. During his previous appearance, Ntuli, who represented himself, told the court of alleged torture and harassment he had been getting at the police station and requested that the court move him to Westville prison. Ntuli said he had been suffocated with plastic and had bruises all over his body. He said he feared for his life. -TNA Reporter
