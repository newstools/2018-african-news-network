President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on the country’s soldiers to remain resilient and committed to serving the people of South Africa and other nations. “At the interfaith service I attended on Sunday, I saw in our armed forces a reflection of South Africa we are constantly seeking to build. I saw the diversity of our country enveloped in your uniforms,” Ramaphosa said. “The participation of all faiths in the Sunday event was a reminder of the inclusive society we are building. It was heartening to see the wonderful, creative talent of men and women in uniform on display.” Speaking in his capacity as Commander in Chief of the SANDF at the commemoration of Armed Forces Day in Kimberley, Ramaphosa said Armed Forces Day was a reminder that soldiers were an integral part of the nation, not an external force. “We dare not fail to appreciate how the peace we enjoy lives alongside the constant vigilance and readiness that enables you to keep us as safe as we are. You are opening incredible opportunities for young people in both the public and private sectors.” In 2012, a decision was taken to proclaim 21 February as Armed Forces Day, the day the SS Mendi sunk in World War I. #ArmedForcesDay2018 A total of 616 of South African black troops died when the SS Mendi steamship sank on its way to France. pic.twitter.com/afMPIj4MU9 — South African Government (@GovernmentZA) February 21, 2018 The SS Mendi was transporting 823 members of the Fifth Battalion, the South African Native Labour Corps to France when it was struck by the SS Darro. “On the day, we remember the bravery of soldiers prepared to fight in a war that was not theirs. It is recorded that as the SS Mendi sank, the soldiers chose to die with dignity and honour.” -TNA Reporter
