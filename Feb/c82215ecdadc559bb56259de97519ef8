 In April 2014, the court ordered the Department of Social Development take over payments of social grants due to irregular tender processes in appointing CPS. According to reports, Sassa has now filed papers with the court arguing that it needs more time to sort out the matter of cash payments for 2.5 million beneficiaries before the contract expires at the end of March. On Wednesday, Sassa celebrated reportedly paying over two million beneficiaries from commercial banks through its Paymaster General account. “This move is a giant step taken towards Sassa ultimately paying all beneficiaries using any type of electronic payment method. It is part of fully complying with orders of the Constitutional Court and phasing out CPS, the current service provider,” Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said. Reports of the bid for an extension comes amid an ongoing probe into Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini’s role in the social grants debacle. The court ordered an investigation into whether Dlamini should be held personally liable for the costs during the payments crisis. CPS announced that it would require R194 million a month to disburse social grants for two years, amounting to a total contract worth R4.6 billion. Former Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza earlier this month during his testimony accused the minister of having pushed for Sassa to go for CPS, adding that she also advocated for a contract extension and later for a new contract. Magwaza also said Dlamini knew as far back as July 2015 that Sassa would not able to take over grant payments. Attempts to reach Sassa for comment were unsuccessful at the time of publishing. -TNA Reporter
