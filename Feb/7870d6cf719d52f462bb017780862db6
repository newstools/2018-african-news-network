Minister of Women in the Presidency Susan Shabangu, together with North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, will on Monday launch the roll-out of National Dialogues for no violence against women and children. The roll-out will take place in four district municipalities in the North West. According to the department, the focus of the dialogues might vary from district to district, as they will be informed by the social issues and challenges unique to each area. “The National Dialogues were piloted in Limpopo and rolled out in the Northern Cape and Mpumalanga provinces as part of 365 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children. The dialogues are a platform for deepening democracy while ensuring safer and crime-free communities, especially for women and children,” the department said in a statement. The department is undertaking the National Dialogues in partnership with the North West provincial government, North West department of social development, respective municipalities, faith-based organisations, traditional leaders, civil society organisations, legal and private sectors.” The objective of the National Dialogues is to assist the Department of Women and government to best understand the nature and root causes of the scourge of femicide, rape and violence against women and children, in order to inform government’s response and course of action. -TNA Reporter
