The DA has laid a formal complaint with Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane against Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba ahead of his budget speech on Wednesday. The DA wants Gigaba to be investigated for “lying” under oath and for violating the Constitution while he was still serving as Minister of Home Affairs between 2014 and 2017. The DA said that a recently published court judgment on the matter between Fireblade Aviation and the former home affairs minister revealed damning findings against Gigaba. The judgment followed a 2016 case where Gigaba had initially allowed Fireblade Aviation to operate a private customs and immigration service at a privately owned airport operation. However, Gigaba later reversed the decision. The company then sought a declaratory order to compel him to abide by his initial decision. It was alleged at the time that Gigaba had taken the decision to revoke the approval he initially granted as a result of pressure on him from the Gupta family. According to the DA, the judgment found Gigaba to have “deliberately told untruths under oath”. Meanwhile, findings on his decisions and conduct were that “the minister committed a breach of the Constitution so serious that I could characterise it as a violation.” The DA said these findings called for an investigation into Gigaba for breaching the Constitution. Furthermore, the DA wants the ANC to act against Gigaba. “The ANC should now be compelled to act against Gigaba if indeed they are a ‘renewed’ organisation. This is the true test for President Cyril Ramaphosa and his party – steps must be taken to remove Gigaba as a matter of urgency.” -TNA Reporter
