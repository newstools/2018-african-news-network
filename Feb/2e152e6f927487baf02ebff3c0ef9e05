The Vuwani Regional Court has sentenced a 19-year-old to nine years behind bars, without the option of a fine, for public violence. Ridovhona Tshiwandalane was reportedly part of an angry mob that damaged several vehicles belonging to the police, the SABC and private individuals when former President Jacob Zuma failed to address residents, as promised, in May last year. The other accused, Aluwani Maphiri, 23, will stand for trial on 19 March, while three others, Innocent Motabatshidi, 22, Ntshangedzeni Mudau, 31 and Ntungufhadzeni Makhitha, 36, will stand trial on 20 March. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said there are 62 other cases linked to public violence, which resulted in over 30 schools being reduced to ashes. “Investigations into these cases are still pending,” Motlafela said. -TNA Reporter
