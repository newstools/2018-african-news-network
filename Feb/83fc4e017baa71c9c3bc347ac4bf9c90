National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) advocate Shaun Abrahams has directed the prosecution team to provide him with recommendations on whether to charge President Jacob Zuma for corruption. Abrahams has given the prosecutors till February 23 to give him recommendations on the charges Zuma is facing. This comes after DA filed papers with the NPA outlining why 783 counts of fraud, money laundering, corruption and racketeering against Zuma should be reinstated. President Zuma had lost his appeal against a high court ruling that charges against him should be reinstated. In january, Zuma filled papers with NPA explaining why he should not face the charges reinstated. The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) dismissed Zuma and NPAâ€™s appeal application to appeal the ruling that the dropping of the corruption charges against him was irrational. -TNA Reporter
