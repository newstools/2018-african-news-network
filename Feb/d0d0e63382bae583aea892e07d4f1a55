A massive manhunt has been launched by the police in Makhado outside Thohoyandou for a group of armed suspects after they allegedly blew up a cash-in-transit vehicle on Monday. It is alleged that a cash-in-transit vehicle was travelling from Musina when a Toyota Double Cab GT6 overtook it and subsequently started shooting continuously until the driver made a U-turn, trying to save their lives. Captain Richard Boshomane said: “Unfortunately, there were other oncoming vehicles which were also shooting at them, aiming at the tires and causing the cash-in-transit vehicle to come to a standstill.” “The group of suspects blew up the safe on this security vehicle, robbed an undisclosed amount of cash before they fled the scene.” One security officer was shot and injured but there were no fatalities. No arrests have been made. -TNA Reporter
