Workers reportedly claimed that management failed to meet demands submitted by Nehawu in September 2017. Chief Executive Officer Steven Zwane said: “As management, we believe that we are still on track with our negotiations and have made progress in some areas because we have already agreed to most of the individual demands in principle.” He said they remained committed to the initial agreement with the union to meet on 22 February to further discuss the outstanding items in order to solicit their commitment before submission can be made to the board for consideration. Zwane assured that NSFAS would be working with Nehawu and the board to address the issues speedily, to ensure that colleagues were back at work, serving the South African public in the implementation of the new fee-free education policy. -TNA Reporter
