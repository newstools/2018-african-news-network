The ANC is incapable of fighting corruption and maladministration from within its ranks. This according to EFF leader Julius Malema. Speaking during a media briefing on Thursday, Malema said the ANC played an important part in political liberation but it was totally incapable of leading society to economic equality and prosperity. “The ANC is not an organisation that is capable of leading South Africa beyond political liberation,” Malema said. Malema also said that if the ANC of Cyril Ramaphosa was honest and truly sought a new and stable future, it must agree to the call for early elections. “Parliament has been complicit in creating the personality cult that is Jacob Zuma and it must be dissolved to reconstitute a new leadership of South Africa with a fresh mandate from the general participation of our people through elections.” “The ANC has developed a tradition of building personality cults who are beyond reproach. In all these sins and shenanigans, the ANC was the shield that protected Jacob Zuma from being held accountable.” He also emphasised that the ANC defended Zuma even when the whole of society said he was a problem, so a permanent solution in South Africa would be to totally extinguish the ANC from political office. -TNA Reporter
