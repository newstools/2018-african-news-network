Police Minister Fikile Mbalula will revisit the Manguzi community in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday. Following community protests against cross-border crimes, Mbalula together with SAPS National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sithole visited the Manguzi earlier this month to intervene. Mbalula,  who’s second visit was delayed due to new developments in Parliament,  promised the community that he will return with a strong response and intervention. “Our people are not protesting for the sake of it, they do so because there is a real concern and their government must listen to them. The people of Manguzi have been complaining about cross-border crime and theft of motor vehicles and this is a serious concern, ” he said. After listening to the people during the first visit, Mbalula has made an undertaking to go back with a comprehensive strategy to deal with matters raised by the community. -TNA Reporter
