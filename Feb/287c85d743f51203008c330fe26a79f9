AN APPLICATION by three organisations to have the Constitutional Court reinstate Mxolisi Nxasana as national director of public prosecutions will be heard on Wednesday. Nxasana accepted a golden R17.3m handshake to exit his post from former president Jacob Zuma in 2015. North Gauteng High Court judge Mlambo ordered Nxasana to repay all the money he received to the state as part of his settlement. Corruption Watch, Freedom Under Law and the Helen Suzman Foundation have called for Nxasana to be reinstated on the basis that this should be a natural consequence of the high court ruling. A 26-year-old man, accused of dropping rocks from a bridge, will appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court today. He made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court last Monday, charged with two counts of malicious damage to property after he allegedly dropped two large rocks from the bridge‚ which struck cars passing beneath it. The suspect was arrested last week, amid a spate of rock throwing incidents on the N3 under the Tollgate bridge. A 51-year-old man, arrested for a double murder and nine attempted murders at the Langa taxi rank on Thursday morning, will appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court. Lt-Col Andrè Traut said: “The same suspect is also believed to be linked to another Langa murder, which was perpetrated earlier this month. The arrest is a culmination of our investigations that started two weeks ago regarding taxi related conflict in the area.” keitumetsim@thenewage.co.za –
