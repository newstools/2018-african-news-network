The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has on Monday announced that it has reached a R1 trillion in revenue collection. Sars said the R1 trillion reached makes it the third year in a row that it reached this milestone. SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane said the achievement was testament to the organisation’s commitment to reaching the increased revenue target of R 1.217-trillion. “We are focused on closing all revenue leakages through non-compliance and our staff will spare no effort in reaching the revenue target by 29 March, even though the economy is not performing to our expectations,” said Moyane. “We believe that our efforts will provide government with the requisite fiscal space to free up resources for its developmental objectives while allowing it to better manage the levels of debt we are facing,” said the Commissioner. -TNA Reporter
