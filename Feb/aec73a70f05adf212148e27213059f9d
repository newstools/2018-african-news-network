The ANC in Gauteng has condemned the actions of the so-called “Zuma Must Go” group, who have called for a national shut down on Monday. This comes after a group of ANC members announced that they would demonstrate outside the Union Buildings in Pretoria, in an attempt to put pressure on President Jacob Zuma to step down. However, the ANC has urged its members to stay away from the march as it said the group does not speak on behalf of the ANC. “The ANC calls on its members, supporters and society at large not to heed this irresponsible and reckless call by these individuals who have no mandate to speak on behalf of the ANC or any of its members and structures. “We have further noted that certain individuals alleged to be ANC members, clad in ANC regalia, took part in an unmandated press briefing earlier today. The province has given a directive to its regions to embark on the process of verifying their membership status and to institute disciplinary action for any transgression and violation of the ANC code of conduct,” the ANC said in a statement. The call for South Africans to take part in the march followed growing calls for Zuma to step down. Meanwhile, the ANC’s alliance partners have also joined the call for Zuma to step aside and allowing the party’s president Cyril Ramaphosa to take over. -TNA Reporter
