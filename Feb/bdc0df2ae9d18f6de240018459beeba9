The suspect arrested for murder and kidnapping two Mpumalanga children appeared briefly at the Witbank Magistrate’s Court. The suspect was remanded in custody for a formal bail application scheduled for February 26. On Wednesday the body of a one-year-old was found in a stream near the N4 highway outside Emalahleni while the body of a 12-year-old was found buried in a shallow grave in Cullinan. The bodies found are believed to be those of the missing Gabisile Shabani and Nkosikhona Ngwenya. Three suspects had broken into their home in Hlalanikahle on 20 January and kidnapped children. Provincial spokesperson Leonard Hlathi said, “a postmortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death as the bodies were in a bad state”. -TNA Reporter
