The case against a man accused of killing a 12-year-old girl living with albinism and her cousin has been postponed to 6 March. The 32-year-old man appeared briefly at the Witbank Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday for a formal bail application. During the appearance, his lawyer stated that they need more time to prepare for bail and requested a postponement. It is reported that three suspects had broken into their home in Hlalanikahle on 20 January and kidnapped the children. Gabisile’s body was found buried in a shallow grave in Cullinan without a head and some body parts. Meanwhile, the body of Nkosikhona Ngwenya (1) was found near the N4 Highway outside Emalahleni after he was mistakenly kidnapped at his home by armed robbers who wanted his albino cousin of the same age as him. Outside the court, angry residents demanded that the man should be handed over to them. Police were forced to fire rubber bullets to disperse the community after throwing stones and bottles damaging the court. -TNA Reporter
