President Jacob Zuma’s oldest son Edward said he will lodge a complaint with the ANC Integrity Committee against NEC Member Bheki Cele for his attack on Secretary-General Ace Magashule. Edward said Cele was irresponsible in his attack and should be held accountable for bringing the party into disrepute. While addressing an ANC rally to celebrate the party’s 106 birthday at Vryheid in northern KwaZulu-Natal earlier this month, Cele accused Magashule of destroying the party and introducing the Gupta family. “There is one who said he was introduced to the Guptas by the ANC and he happened to be the SG. I have never met a person who was introduced to the Guptas by the ANC. Ace Magashule says he was. “So there is one who was taken on a tray to the Guptas but he does not say what his programme is, we are beginning to suspect that his programme is to destroy the ANC‚” said Cele during his address. Edward said he will be launching a complaint as he believes Cele’s comments are utter nonsense. “You would not expect that from the leader of the national congress particularly when we are speaking unity and this person is speaking like this,” Zuma told the SABC. -TNA Reporter
