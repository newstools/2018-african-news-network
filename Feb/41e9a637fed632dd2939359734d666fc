City of Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba has referred himself to the council’s Ethics Committee following allegations of corruption against him. “Whilst I believe I have responded to the matter sufficiently, I have committed to run the City of Johannesburg whilst holding myself to the highest ethical standards. It is time that citizens believe in their political leadership, and this can only happen when we set the bar higher,” Mashaba said. This follows reports that the mayor allegedly hired his wife’s company to do business with the city. Mashaba has denied this reports and further demanded the publication to apologise to him and his wife for the false reporting. Mashaba clarified that he had however acquired the services of a former business associate to assist the city with the financial modeling of a project of in-sourcing security personnel in the city. According to the mayor, the business associate then did the service “free of charge”. “I have written to the Speaker of Council, Cllr Vasco Da Gama, requesting that the allegations contained in the Sowetan newspaper are investigated,” he said He says that there was no conflict of interest in the matter as the project was not an unsolicited bid and no advantage or benefit was derived from it by the business associate. “It was a dedicated South African willing to give of their time, free of charge, to the benefit of our City.” Mashaba claims that the allegations are perpetuated by those that have a business interest in tenders to offer security service in the city. “The simple truth is that this move to insource security guards in the City caused a lot of unhappiness in the circles of the politically connected few who have made a fortune from the over 90 security contracts that the City has held valued at R640 million.” -TNA Reporter
