The husband of one of the JMPD officers knocked down by a drunk driver in Fourways, Johannesburg on Monday has said he is going to need all the help he can get to raise his two sons. The man was speaking during a memorial service organised by the city of Johannesburg to honour the two Metro Police officers. Sophie Ngoasheng and Winnie Mokgolo were killed when a motorist ran them over at a roadblock. Ngoasheng’s husband Damari said he was heartbroken by his wife’s tragic death. “I am heartbroken by the fact that my sons are going to grow up without their mother as a result of an irresponsible driver.” Wreaths were also laid at the spot where the two officers died. The event was attended by Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba, MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun and Chief of Police David Tembe. -TNA Reporter
