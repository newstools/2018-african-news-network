Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha commended the government on the recent announcement of fee-free education in his State of the Province Address on Friday. Mathabatha said children in this country should indeed be able to access free higher education regardless of their family background. “The days of education being an exclusive commodity and preserved for the privileged few are over.” He said that the fight against poverty, unemployment and inequality begins with the improvement of the education system which is why the province has committed to providing scholar transport for learners whose schools are 5km away from their homes. Last year the provincial government provided scholar transport to 255 schools across the province. “This year we are increasing the number of schools which will benefit from scholar transport to 380.” Mathabatha also said the province will work on improving schools infrastructure, building new schools and expanding the connection of decent sanitation facilities in schools. “Our work will include the building of new classrooms, new schools and the renovation and maintenance of existing infrastructure.” -TNA Reporter
