KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner Bheki Langa has condemned members of the community for taking the law into their own hands. His comments follow the arrest of five people for allegedly being involved in acts of vigilantism in the KwaMashu area. Bonga Mathonsi, Khethani Goba, Jabulile Goba, Sanele Goba and Sandile Sibisi were released on an R1000 bail each after appearing at the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court where they faced charges of Murder. Police spokesperson Thulani Zwane said they expect to make more arrest relating to the case. According to Zwane, the five are linked to the attack murder of an unknown victim who was allegedly assaulted by a group of people at Phothwe road in K section kwaMashu on Tuesday last week. “The attackers accused the victim of being involved in criminal activities in the area hence the assault,” Zwane said.
