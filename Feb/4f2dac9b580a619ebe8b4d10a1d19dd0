Joburg Emergency Manager Services (EMS) ambulance was attacked in Honeydew whilst transporting a pregnant woman to the hospital. It is reported that the attack happened while EMS paramedics responded to an emergency maternity case in the area when a brick was lunged into the back of the ambulance breaking the back window. No suspects have been identified regarding the incident, however, the Department of Public Safety EMS have opened a case at the Honeydew Police Station for malicious damage to the city’s property. MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun stated that the attack against EMS is absolutely appalling and unacceptable. “It is not only an attack on the City but on the most vulnerable residents in the City,” said Sun. This recent attack comes after another attack took place late last year in Cosmo City where paramedics were robbed. “We will continue to work with our community members to ensure they understand that this kind of crimes does them many disservices and they should work closely with us to eradicate this criminal behaviour,” Sun said. -TNA Reporter
