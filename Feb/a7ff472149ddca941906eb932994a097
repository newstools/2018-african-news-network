The Hawks have once again called on Ajay Gupta to hand himself over to authorities after his lawyer questioned reports that he is a fugitive from justice. The Hawks announced last week it was now considering the oldest of the powerful Gupta family as a fugitive after he failed to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court where eight suspects appeared to face corruption charges related to the Estina Dairy Farm Project. The Gupta family and their associates allegedly illegally siphoned millions of rands meant for the project. Ajay’s lawyer said he had been asking for the police to provide him with a case number, which to date, had not been provided. This despite the Hawks reiterating that it is in possession of it. Several activists have so far offered R1.54 million for information that may lead to Ajay’s arrest. Earlier this week, Ajay’s brother Atul filed an application to challenge the Asset Forfeiture Unit’s decision to freeze R10 million which was paid into his bank account, allegedly from the Estina Dairy Farm Project. -TNA Reporter
