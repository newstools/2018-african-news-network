The Black First Land First (BLF) movement has announced it will be contesting the 2019 general elections. BLF leader Andile Mngxitama said the people of South Africa need another voice to be added to the current political parties in Parliament. “They want their real voice, that is why they are sending us to Parliament. We are going to Parliament, 2019 we are in Parliament,” Mngxitama said. “Too many people are calling us every day, please BLF, be on the ballot. We are not going to disappoint them.” Mngxitama said the BLF would set up offices across all provinces to be close to the people in preparation to participate in the election. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) on Monday confirmed that the BLF had registered to participate in the 2019 elections. We can confirm that Black First Land First (BLF) is registered with the Electoral Commission for all levels of elections (national, provincial and municipal).

The movement said it wants to make sure that land distribution happens before 2019 and the implementation of Radical Economic Transformation. “We are a movement, not for elections, we are a revolutionary movement outside Parliament, but our people said they also want us in Parliament, so we will do revolution inside Parliament as we do it outside Parliament.” -TNA Reporter
