Another victim who was hit and killed by a stray bullet near his home is a retired soldier Freddy Mpandeni (58) who lived close to the police station. “This is standard procedure during the process of any investigations. People will be questioned and this will not be done differently in this case. A formal announcement will be made should there be any significant developments on the side of the investigation,” Eastern Cape police spokesperson Khaya Tonjeni said. Tonjeni confirmed that at least 10 firearms were stolen from the safe and others from the police members. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, who went to the police station following the attack, has called for calm in the area. “I have instructed General Khehla Sitole (National Commissioner of the SAPS) to hunt down these barbaric criminals and bring them to book. They must regret the day they sat and planned to attack the state,” Mbalula said. -TNA Reporter
