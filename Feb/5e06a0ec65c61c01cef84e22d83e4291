Gauteng motorists have been urged to brace themselves for a disruptive morning on Tuesday during the transportation of a Boeing 737 plane to Fourways Mall. The aircraft is being transported from near OR Tambo International Airport and is being moved across the city in what has been termed an “extremely delicate” operation to a KidZania event – which will be launched in South Africa next month. KidZania is a Mexican chain of indoor entertainment that consists of mini-cities built inside malls. The plane’s wings and the tail section will be transported separately. Areas that are going to be affected include Jet Park‚ Isando‚ Choolorkop‚ Midrand‚ Dainfern and Fourways. The plane is expected to leave its location at 5am and is expected to reach Fourways Mall at 5pm. -TNA Reporter
