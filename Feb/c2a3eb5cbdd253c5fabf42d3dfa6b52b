Metrorail says its central line service in Cape Town is due to be reopened as technicians are working towards this week’s deadline. This comes after the line was suspended for almost six weeks following the murder of a Prasa security guard in Khayelitsha, major safety concerns and damaged infrastructure. #CentalLineCentralCT service remains suspended. Plans to re-open the line are currently underway. Further updates/details to follow early next week. pic.twitter.com/JQetDFZuP4 — Metrorail W/Cape (@CapeTownTrains) February 16, 2018 Over the past two years, Metrorail in Cape Town has reported more than 660 incidents relating to vandalism and attacks.
