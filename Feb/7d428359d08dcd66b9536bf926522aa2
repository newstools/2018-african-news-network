VUYO Mhaga, the spokesperson for Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula, said according to their knowledge based on a memorandum sent by the community to them, the residents did not specifically finger SAPS members in the border crime. “The community in their memorandum didn’t specifically refer to corruption among police,” Mhaga said. He said Mbalula is due back in Manguzi today and he will announce a set of interventions to curb the crime. “Indeed the minister is going back to report, there will be a number of interventions he will deliver to the community of Manguzi.” Mbalula’s visit will be his second in a space of a month after he visited the area when fed up local residents closed the Kosi Bay border post between SA and Mozambique, demanding action on the crime. He met with the community and promised to come up with solutions. Prior to that, in March last year, former president Jacob Zuma visited the area. As a result of his visit, a new satellite police station was opened on the border and the fence was repaired. Despite that, the crimes did not stop. According to the latest crime statistics released in October last year, 3029 cars were stolen in KwaZulu-Natal alone in 2016 and last year. That is an increase of 21.5% over the previous period when 2 493 cars were stolen. At the national level, 16 717 cars were stolen with Gauteng leading the pack where 8 610 cars were stolen. The SA presidency and Mozambican high commission in SA were yet to respond to questions at the time of going to print. news@thenewage.co.za
