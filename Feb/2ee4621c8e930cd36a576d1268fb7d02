The families of the Life Esidimeni tragedy victims will each be paid an amount of R200 000. This was announced at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday morning where Justice Dikgang Moseneke heard closing arguments from legal representatives. Section 27 advocate Adila Hassim who represents the families of 55 patients who died said the state had agreed to pay each family R20 000 for funeral arrangements and R180 000 for emotional trauma and counselling. At least 144 patients died from starvation and dehydration after the Gauteng Health Department moved them to ill-equipped NGOs in 2016. It was also heard that an agreement on the constitutional damage is still pending. Hassim said they agreed with the state that there would be a place for a memorial for the patients who died and that details would be communicated later. “Constitutional damages are not alien or wild. It is not something new and can be provided under these circumstances,” Hassim said. “The way the project was implemented and the reasons why the project was started are inconsistent and this is why they sought constitutional damages.” Hassim emphasised that it was important to consider the fact that the arbitration still did not have an answer as to why the Esidimeni contract was cancelled in the first place.
