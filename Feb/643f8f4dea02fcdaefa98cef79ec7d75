National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has on Wednesday received DA’s request for a motion to dissolve parliament. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said that the request has been processed by the speaker through a confirmation letter from Deputy National Assembly Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli. According to Maimane, the request is in line with section 50(1) of the constitution which speaks about the dissolution of the National Assembly. On Monday while addressing a joint press conference by opposition parties on their way forward should ANC not recall President Jacob Zuma, Maimane announced that he would write to the speaker requesting that the motion is discussed. In his replying letter to Maimane, Tsenoli said: “You will be aware that a motion to dissolve a National Assembly must comply with Section 50 of the constitution and relevant rules for motions.” He said Maimane can attend the programming committee where he would be free to push for this motion to be considered. Maimane said he would indeed push for the motion to be discussed at the committee meeting on Thursday. -TNA Reporter
