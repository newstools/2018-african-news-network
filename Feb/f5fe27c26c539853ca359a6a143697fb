Twenty eight media companies have been referred to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution on charges of price fixing and the fixing of trading conditions in contravention of the Competition Act. An investigation initiated in 2011 found that through the Media Credit Co-Ordinators (MCC), various companies agreed to offer similar discounts and payment terms to advertising agencies that advertise with MCC members. Accredited agencies were offered 16.5% discount while non-members were offered 15%. Competition Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele said implicated companies employed services of an intermediary company called Corexalance to perform risk assessments on advertising agencies to impose a settlement discount structure. “The commission found that the practices restricted competition among competing companies as they did not independently determine the discounts and thereby fixed the price and trading terms in contravention of the Competition Act,” Bonakele said. Bonakele said, in referring the matter to the tribunal for prosecution, the commission seeks an order declaring that the media companies contravened the act and are liable to pay penalties in terms of the act.
