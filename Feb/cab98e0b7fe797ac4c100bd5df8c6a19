Platinum Stars head coach Roger de Sa announced on Thursday that he is part of the consortium of businessmen that bought Platinum Stars FC. “I am part of the entity that bought the club, there is four of us. Two guys in Cape Town and one in Johannesburg,” he said. The club announced of the sale on Wednesday, however, did not divulge more details surrounding the new owners but promised to shed more light on the sale. “The decision to sell the Club was not taken lightly and is one of the most difficult decisions that we have made in a long time. The Club has been part of the Royal Bafokeng Nation for the past 10 years.” De Sá says that their bid was fair and they had followed the right channels and having him as a footballer and part of the consortium had a little influence because he was not there entirely for business but for sport. Meanwhile, Platinum Stars says that the new owners have decided not to move the club but to keep it in Phokeng and make Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace its home ground. “We would like to thank all the members of the Royal Bafokeng Nation and the loyal supporters of the Club for their never-ending support over the years. They have remained committed to the Club through the good and bad times. We will cherish this support forever. “We urge all of you to continue supporting your team and give the same support to the new owners, in the same manner, you have supported us.” -TNA Reporter
