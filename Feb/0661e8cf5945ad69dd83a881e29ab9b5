City of Cape Town Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille says she has been subjected to constant attacks in the media and public by DA members. De Lille said she was aware that DA members did not want her to be the mayor, adding that the matter was rather that of principle. “I will push for justice and for my name to be cleared before considering finding a new home with another political party.” De Lille has obtained a court order to ensure that she stay on as mayor despite the allegations of corruption leveled against her. Meanwhile on Wednesday, the ANC in the Western Cape decided to withdraw a motion of no confidence against de Lille after a series of council meetings. The ANC said it decided to withdraw the motion because it didn’t want to play into the “hands of infighting” in the DA. At the same time, the City Council was expected to debate a motion of no confidence brought by the DA on Wednesday. The decision to table the motion followed allegations of corruption against de Lille, which stated, among others, that she had spent some of the city’s money to refurbish her own house, a claim the mayor has vehemently denied. -TNA Reporter
