THE wife of a police officer working at Ngcobo police station where six officers were shot dead last week says she feels no pity for the alleged killers who were gunned down on Friday. Onwabise Kholisa described the shooting of the seven as a feeling of relief and called for the church where they were found, Moncoba Seven Angels Ministry, to be closed down. “I have no remorse for the criminals who were shot dead during the arrests that were made on Saturday. I am still worried that there might still be another attack. What if these people want to take revenge on the police for killing some of their people? I have been worried sick every time my husband leaves the house to report for duty at the same police station where the police were killed last Wednesday. “I am trying to remain positive and not stress as I am five months pregnant,” Kholisa said. “We need to feel safe in our own home and not scared of criminals in our community.” While Kholisa’s family continues to live in fear and the families of the murdered police officers and the suspected killers are preparing to bury them, a war of words between Parliament and the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL) has erupted. CRL chairperson Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva accused Parliament of failing to prevent the incident at the weekend. Speaking to The New Age yesterday, Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said they had previously warned that the church was “an accident waiting to happen”. “We always knew that eventually they would run out of money and they would resort to something drastic,” Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said. -SISANDA MDWANTSI AND LILLIAN SELAPISA
