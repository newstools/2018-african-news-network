YESTERDAY was visiting day in Cape Town as ANC national leaders visited places of worship and religious significance, with party president being at St George’s Cathedral in central Cape Town. Secretary-general Jessie Duarte and Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor were in Faure to visit the Kramat or tomb of Sheik Yusuf. Exiled to Cape Town by the Dutch from Indonesia in 1694, Yusuf is widely regarded as having brought Islam to SA. Treasurer-general Paul Mashatile also attended a prayer service at the Jafta Methodist Church in Guguletu with NEC members Bheki Cele and the Deputy Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, Mcebisi Skwatsha. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa, deputy president David Mabuza, secretary-general Ace Magashule, Duarte and Mashatile withdrew from visits on Friday for speculative reasons. – TNA Reporter
