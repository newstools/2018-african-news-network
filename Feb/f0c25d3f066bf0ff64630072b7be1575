GAUTENG education department says that it is convinced that all pupils will be in schools by mid February. The department still needs to place 111 Grade 1 pupils and 158 Grade 8 pupils. Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said that the department was facing some challenges but he was convinced that by mid February all pupils will be placed. “We are almost there! It’s tough but we are trying. I am convinced all pupils will be in class by February 15, 2018,” Lesufi said The department plans to place the remaining 269 pupils by February 15. “On day 16 of the 2018 academic year, the total number of applications, including applications made from May to November last year and January this year had increased to 321 910 of these, 321 641 applicants are placed and 269 applicants remain unplaced,” the departments spokesperson, Steve Mabona, said. A total of 57 applicants from the 285 834 applications which were made during the early application period last year are still unplaced. “The 22921 applicants were made during the late application period (June 13, 2017 to November 10). 22834 applicants are placed and 87 are unplaced,” Mabona said. The 125 pupils from the group of new applicants who applied during the new application are still yet to be placed as the departments has only managed to place 13030 applicants so far. Mabona said the department was still convinced that the online application system was the way to go. “It is convenient to parents and the department is able to place a substantial number of pupils in a short space of time.” Meanwhile the department is challenging the Pretoria High Court’s decision to set aside its directive that Overvaal High School in Vereeniging must admit 55 English pupils. The department on Monday filed an application to appeal the matter directly at the Constitutional Court. The 55 pupils have been placed in other schools while the department appeals. The department plans to invite the 55 pupils to intervene in the application so that they can describe their circumstances and finally participate in the proceedings which has had a directive impact on their rights and interest. The department said it attempted to obtain a final decisive judgment on the issues early enough to inform the 2019 admission process. shonisanit@thenewage.co.za
