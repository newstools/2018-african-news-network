The DA has on Thursday expressed its concerns about the latest violence and protests in North West. The party said it has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa earlier this week, calling him to put the province’s people first and take their suffering and current chaos into consideration. This followed the protest that took place in Mafikeng, where roads were closed and some vehicles were torched. The DA North West leader Joe McGluwa said that the province is in shambles but the ANC would rather protect Premier Supra Mahumapelo and their party than intervene and protect the interests of the people. “Mahumapelo is an opposition to the practice of putting the people first and the work of any dedicated leader of society. He has, in all his dealings, placed his interests and allegedly those of the Gupta family, ahead of the people of the province.
“The people of the North West will punish the ANC in 2019, and vote for total change under a DA-led administration that puts the people and service delivery first.” -TNA Reporter
