THE ANC Youth League secretarygeneral Njabulo Nzuza said the death of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela should challenge young people to learn from the fallen heros and heroines of the struggle. Nzuza was speaking during the unveiling of the icon’s tribute wall outside the party headquarters in Johannesburg. The wall allows the general public to write messages in memory of Madikizela-Mandela. Nzuza said young people of the country should not just think of themselves but work for the good of the country. “Young people need to build their own political consciousness and understand that they have a role to play in the country,” he said. Nzuza said for the sake of the ANC and the country, priority had to be placed on the young, just as MadikizelaMandela recognised the power of young people. “She identified problems faced by the young people as a ticking time bomb. We hope that we are not just going to be celebrating Mama Winnie by talking and by addressing lectures, but by taking steps which will benefit building of a society that takes care its young people.” He said that young South Africans must not be made to wait in limbo, as her death should be a motivating factor that drives young people. “We will continue to celebrate the life and times of Mama Winnie through memorials but we request everyone do something that makes a change in squatter camps named after Mama Winnie,” Nzuza said. hlonim@thenewage.co.za -HLONI MASHIGO
