Danny Jordaan’s lawyers have on Tuesday dismissed the rape claims leveled against their client by the former African National Congress (ANC) MP Jennifer Ferguson. In March, Ferguson laid a criminal charge against Jordaan. She is accusing Jordaan of raping her 24 years ago at Port Elizabeth hotel. Mohlala Attorneys said they have not seen a docket regarding the rape case opened against Jordaan. “Despite numerous attempts to contact authorities including two letters directed to the South African Police Service, we have been unable to determine any information about the whereabouts of the docket. The lack of information is damaging our client. “As Mohlala Attorneys, we have attempted to engage the SAPS and the investigating officer in this matter and will soon contact the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in an attempt to have the matter dealt with as soon as reasonably possible,” Mohlala Attorneys said. -TNA Reporter
