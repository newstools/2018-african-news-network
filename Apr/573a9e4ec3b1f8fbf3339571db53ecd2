The son of North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has reportedly been offered a bursary worth over R1.1 million to study as a pilot by state-owned defence company Denel. The City Press is reporting that a bursary contract between Supra Oarabile Mahumapelo, 20 and Denel – seen by its sister paper Rapport – shows the company has apparently undertaken to pay for Mahumapelo’s son flight classes, accommodation, meals and laundry costs. The Rapport said Debel allegedly had to “bend the rules” to offer Mahumapelo’s son the bursary. In its initial response to the reports, Denel denied there being anything untoward regarding the offering of the bursary. However, it is reported that following an intervention by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, Denel has now changed its statement. Gordhan has allegedly asked for an investigation into the matter.  -TNA Reporter
