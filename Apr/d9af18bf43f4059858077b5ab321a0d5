The negotiations, which started in December, where organised labour presented joint demands which included 15% salary increase or R3 150, R2 000 housing allowance (across the board) to name but a few. “Following the presentation of the facilitator’s proposal, we will be consulting our members in the form of general meetings which will culminate in special provincial executive committees and a special central executive committee meeting which would consolidate the position of the union,” Samwu said. The housing allowance will increase by 7% to R851.72 while an additional R350 will be advanced to employees earning less than R9000. The minimum wage will also increase by 7% from July 1 with a further 0.5% January 1 bringing the total to R7 360.86. “These increases will assist in bringing the lagging local government subsidies in line with its comparable counterparts in the private sector,” Koen said. Unions locked in negotiations released a joint media statement in which they said in the seven months period all was done in good faith after numerous delays. “Negotiators have reached the highest level of indignation having had to negotiate overnight on a few occasions in the interest of workers and the public at large,” the statement read. hlonim@thenewage.co.za -HLONI MASHIGO
