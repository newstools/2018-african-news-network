Lobby group AfriForum has announced that it will on Thursday reveal the name of a prominent figure who is their next target for a private prosecution. Their latest target is alleged to be a well-known leader of a political party. On Thursday AfriForum Deputy CEO Ernst Roets said that “this is going to be the main news”. Advocate Gerrie Nel who resigned as a state prosecutor in 2017 is expected to make the announcement. AfriForum has previously brought a number of cases for prosecution. The National Director of Public Prosecutions has recently reconsidered to prosecute former President Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane Zuma on his criminal charges of the culpable homicide of 2014. Duduzane Zuma was involved in a vehicle accident that led to the death of one person. AfriForum has also approached the High Court in the case against Grace Mugabe on her diplomatic immunity case. This case is expected to be heard on 8 May at the High Court. -TNA Reporter
