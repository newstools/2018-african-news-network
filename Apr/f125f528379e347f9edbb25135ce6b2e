THE National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said that it was concerned about recent developments and statements supposedly released as facts into the public domain about the listeriosis outbreak. The institute said that it was particularly worried about the confusion that emanated from statements made at the meeting called by the parliamentary portfolio committee on agriculture on March 28. Dr Juno Thomas, head of the Centre for Enteric Diseases at NICD said: “Of major concern are the claims that the primary source of the outbreak is still unknown and that the Minister of Health has backed down on his previous announcement that the source had been identified, both of which we deny.” Thomas said that the statements made by the Minister of Health emanated from epidemiologic and scientific investigations conducted by the NICD. “The implication that the NICD has misled the Minister of Health and the public is rejected. Furthermore, we condemn the statement made that the government prematurely scapegoated Enterprise and Rainbow without sufficient evidence. We contend that this evidence has been amply provided by the NICD,” he said. He said they did not regard these claims as a small matter, because the NICD is not just a routine diagnostic laboratory with an impact localised in South Africa. “Its work goes far beyond the borders of our country and has an international impact. In outbreaks of this nature, the NICD is obligated by the International Health Regulations to report findings through the national Department of Health to the World Health Organisation and cannot afford to, and does not, mislead.” -DIKELEDI MOLOBELA|dikeledir@thenewage.co.za
