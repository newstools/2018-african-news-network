The African Renaissance Unity Party (A.R.U) has on Monday expressed shock at the death of struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.  Madikizela-Mandela has passed away at the Netcare Milpark Hospital, Johannesburg. “Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was one of the powerful, strongest people I have come to know. She was indeed the mother of the nation, she fought the good fight for South Africa during former President Mandela’s incarceration and beyond. She continued to stand and fight for the rights of the people, and for this the African Renaissance Unity Party is grateful to her for sharing her life with the nation”, said A.R.U. President King Mthimkhulu III. A.R.U said Madikizela-Mandela was an inspiration to all Africans. “Ms. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela demonstrated leadership throughout her political career; herself being incarcerated, being in solitary confinement, her transition from the leader of the movement to government. “The African Renaissance Unity Party appreciates her guidance towards the governing party which along the way moved away from its purpose, ensuring that the party does not forget that it exist for the people. Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was an inspiration to all Africans, not only in South Africa but in the entire African Diaspora,” said Mthimkhulu III. -TNA Reporter
