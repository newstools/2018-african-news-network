A woman is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday for possession of two stolen electricity meters. The woman was arrested on Monday for being in possession the meters, worth R4 000. It is alleged that power supply to the suspect’s property was disconnected last week during operation Buya Mthetho, as her account was in arrears. The operation was led by the city’s Group Forensic and Investigation Services (GFIS), working together with the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) and City Power. “I have faith that the GFIS, JMPD and the operation Buya Mthetho team, working with our law enforcement partners, will do all it can to ensure lawbreakers are held to account,” city of Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba said. “The city, working with all state enforcement agencies, will not leave any stone unturned when dealing with criminal activities within our area of jurisdiction.” -TNA Reporter
