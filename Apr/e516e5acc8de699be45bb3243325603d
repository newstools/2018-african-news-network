Member of the Mayoral Committee for Community Development Cllr Nonhlanhla Sifumba has urged residents of Bellevue and Yeoville to take care of the new parks as the City of Joburg has invested millions. “Please look after these parks. Although the City of Joburg has invested millions, they belong to you and you must ensure they are not vandalised,” said Sifumba. MMC Sifumba on Wednesday launched two parks, which cost a combined R6 million and employed seven local residents during the construction phase. #BuildingNewJozi The kids couldn’t wait any longer to try out their new play equipment #cavendishpark #bellevuepark ^NB pic.twitter.com/VCNfAT8bBH — City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) April 4, 2018 The Newly renovated #cavendishpark in the Joburg Inner City #BuildingNewJozi ^NB pic.twitter.com/MO3RSLB1lG — City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) April 4, 2018 JCPZ Managing Director Brian Maduka said the City was on course to open more parks soon following the launch of the R14 million Juskei Park in Alexandra last month. “The Westdene Park is 95% complete and Patterson Park near Norwood is almost complete,” Maduka said. The City’s new administration has committed to rejuvenate the inner city and grow the city’s economy by 5% by 2021. “To achieve this goal, it is imperative that the inner city attracts visitors and investors. The rejuvenation of parks will make the inner city more attractive to locals and to potential investors,” said Sifumba. She added that millions have been invested in the upgrade of parks to ensure that the previously forgotten people of the inner city are included in the city’s green footprint.  -TNA Reporter
