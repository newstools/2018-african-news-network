The National Health Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) on Wednesday called on Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba to be realistic about solving the problems currently engulfing his department. This followed Gigaba’s surprise visit to the Orlando West offices in Soweto, where he said his department should give a comprehensive report and strategy on managing long queues at the offices. He said the aim of the report was to help the department deal with the delayed processes caused by long queues. Nehawu General-Secretary Zola Saphetha said the union was calling on the minister to focus on a perpetual crisis that the union had been highlighting for a long time. “At the centre of the long queues and delayed processes at the Home Affairs offices, is the issue of short staffing and an overworked workforce. The national union throughout the years has emphasised that short staffing is at the centre of the problems of the department, especially in the ports of entry,” Saphetha said. Nehawu has urged Gigaba to deal with the “horrible” working conditions that its members are subjected to, as a matter of urgency. “Most of the offices are still without functioning ablution facilities, safe and working lifts, and proper security.” -TNA Reporter
