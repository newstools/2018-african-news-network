A former apartheid-era security police member has poured cold water over some of the allegations previously blamed on the late ANC stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists. Former apartheid-era security police officer and Covert Strategic Communications (Stratcom) member Paul Erasmus, who was himself involved in an operation aimed at discrediting many anti-apartheid activists, said Madikizela-Mandela was high up on the list of people who were supposed to be discredited by the regime. He made the revelation on Talk Radio 702 to breakfast show host Bongani Bingwa. Erasmus said it had always been a part and parcel of the plan to portray Mama Winnie as being a hopeless drunkard and an unstable individual who had a relationships with everyone that came along. Erasmus said that when he had decided to leave Stratcom and informed Mandela about all the government’s dirty trick campaigns against her, his former colleagues then fabricated a lie that he (Erasmus) was involved in an extramarital affair with Madikizela-Mandela, despite her being more than 20 years his senior. He also said anyone who still believed that Madikizela-Mandela killed young anti-apartheid activist Stompie Seipei obviously did not know what they were talking about. “I have spent many years trying to undo all the injustice that was committed against Mama Winnie. The world believes what it wants to believe and in this case, people chose to believe that Mama was a murderer without any shred of evidence.” -TNA Reporter
