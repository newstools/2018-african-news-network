Cope in the Free State has asked the Public Protector to investigate allegations that millions of rands were wasted on a farewell party for outgoing premier Ace Magashule and the inauguration of his successor Sisi Ntombela. Last week, media reports emerged that more than R20 million was going to be spent on Magashule’s farewell and Ntombela’s inauguration at the Cheetahs Rugby Stadium. Cope provincial Secretary Mzwandile Hleko said whatever the event was called, it was fruitless expenditure, which was not budgeted for and money was diverted from key delivery projects to corrupt service providers who may not have been appointed through legal procurement procedures. “Cope wants the Free State community to remember this wasteful and fruitless expenditure which is part of the overall decision by the ANC to institutionalise corruption and will not get tired of defending the Constitution and ensuring that all South Africans are equal before the law,” Hleko said. Hleko also lauded all civil servants and the province’s residents who refused to participate in the activities, which he said wasted public funds. “We urge the Public Protector to speed up this investigation and make the findings public.” -TNA Reporter
