Two police officers will appear at Mokopane Magistrates Court on Thursday after they were arrested by the Hawks for corruption. According to Limpopo Hawks spokesperson Matimba Maluleke, the two officers, a Warrant Officer and a Constable who are both stationed at Mokopane Police Station were arrested on Tuesday after being caught in an entrapment. “The Hawks were informed by the family member of a foreign national who has just been arrested that the officers were demanding an R500 bribe from him. “An operation was carried out, resulting in the arrest of the suspects after they accepted the bribe,” Maluleke said. He said the two will face charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice and kidnapping when they appear in court. -TNA Reporter
