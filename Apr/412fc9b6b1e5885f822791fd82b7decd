The area of Daveyton in Ekurhuleni was shut down on Monday morning, as residents demanded decent housing for shack dwellers. It is alleged that the protest started on Sunday night, which left workers stranded as there were no taxis travelling in or out the community on Monday morning. Residents have called on the municipality to build decent houses for people who have been on a housing beneficiary list and to also provide houses for those who have moved out of their family homes, due to domestic quarrels. -TNA Reporter
