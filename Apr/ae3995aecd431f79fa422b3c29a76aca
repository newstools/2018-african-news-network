Reports coming out of the DA Federal Conference that leader Mmusi Maimane and his supporters’ attempt to have a party president’s term extended to five years were on Sunday thwarted by party delegates. The party also rejected the concept of quotas but instead opted for diversity within its leadership ranks. The party is currently holding its congress at the Tshwane  Events Centre where new leadership will be elected. Last week, DA member of Parliament John Steenhuisen strongly disagreed with the concept of extending the party’s presidential term from three to five years. Maimane is expected to retain his position as the party’s leader. Two weeks ago, DA MPs Michael Cardo and Gavin Davies wrote a letter to the party leadership, which found its way to social media platforms, warning party delegates against using the quota system in choosing the party’s leadership. Cardo and Davis welcomed the party’s resolution not to accept the quota system when choosing party leadership. Davis also welcomed the decision by the congress not to accept the quotas. -TNA Reporter
