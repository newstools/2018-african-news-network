THE decision by Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba to take litigation to the high court as well as the Constitutional Court has run up a legal bill of R874000 up to now. Gigaba disclosed this figure in a written response to a written parliamentary question from DA chief whip John Steenhuisen who had asked him what the total legal costs in the Fireblade vs Minister of Home Affairs were. Gigaba replied that generally the state attorneys decided on the payment of legal fees. “However, the department has, upon receipt of this question, requested the office of the state attorney in question to provide details on the legal costs incurred on the Fireblade matter. The state attorney responded to the department’s request and advised that it had only attended to the processing of the payment of fees in respect of the department’s legal team, which amounted to R874 199.25 thus far,” Gigaba said. Responding to this disclosure, Steenhuisen said it was absolutely unacceptable that Gigaba’s ongoing involvement in the Fireblade Aviation matter would continue to incur legal fees as he attempted to overturn the findings of the high court which concluded that he had lied under oath and violated the Constitution. “Thus far, Gigaba has lost his appeal to a full bench of the high court, a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal and it’s highly likely his bid to have the Constitutional Court hear the matter will also fail,” Steenhuisen said. “The amount of legal costs incurred by the Department of Home Affairs to protect a constitutional delinquent will only continue to escalate as he needlessly pursues this matter at the expense of tax payers.” It was simply not enough for President Cyril Ramaphosa to express “great concern” or “give serious attention” to Gigaba’s unlawful conduct, Steenhuisen said. news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
