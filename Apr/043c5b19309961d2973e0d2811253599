Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane on Thursday condemned the killing of Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) inspector Ayanda Zulu. Zulu was shot twice during the early hours of Wednesday morning as she was leaving her home in Palm Springs, south of Johannesburg. It is alleged that Zulu was confronted by two suspects as she was leaving her home when they shot her twice and fled with her 9mm firearm and two magazines. “The province has been robbed of a selfless and dedicated officer. Her passing is not in vain and it would not weaken the morale of our police force but will instead encourage them to do even more to continue to protect and serve our communities,” Nkosi-Malobane said. In the past seven months, at least 12 Metro Police officers have died in the line of duty in Gauteng, with five of these murders occurring in February. “This must stop. Before we know it, we will be left with no one to protect the citizens of this country. I appeal to the criminal justice system to expedite this case and give the perpetrators the harshest sentence.” -TNA Reporter
