President Cyril Ramaphosa has sent South Africa’s condolences to Algeria over the deaths of 257 people in a plane crash on Wednesday. Two hundred and forty seven passengers and 10 crew members died when a military airplane crashed outside a military base in Boufarik near the capital Algiers, in what has been regarded as the biggest air disaster in the area in many years. The plane went down in a field just outside a military base in Boufarik, 30km south of Algiers and was devoured by flames, the defence ministry said. “The people of South Africa share their pain and loss and extend their most sincere condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this tragic accident,” Ramaphosa said in a statement issued through the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. The Algerian government has declared three days of national mourning. -TNA Reporter
