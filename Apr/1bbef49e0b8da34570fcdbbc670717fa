Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) leader Julius Malema will appear at the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court to face charges of instigation after he called on his supporters to occupy any vacant land. In 2014, Afrikaans rights group AfriForum lodged a complaint against Malema after he called on his supporters to occupy any piece of land that was not being utilised during his party’s elective conference in Bloemfontein. In 2016, Malema repeated his call to his supporters when he addressed his supporters after he appeared in the same court on the same charges. He said they should take any beautiful piece of land because it was taken from black people by genocide. His lawyers previously said they would ask the constitutional court to rule on the legality of Righteous Assemblies act under which Malema was charged. The act was used widely during the apartheid era. “This case has been going on for a long time. We hope the trial will be able to resume on Friday” AfriForum spokesperson Ernst Roets said. Roets said he did not know whether Malema’s lawyers have approached the constitutional court to get a clarity on the legality of the act as they promised that they would. “I am not aware of the constitutional court ruling on the act’s legality. But I am sure the court will clarify on that.” Malema is expected to give a keynote address at the EFF’s Land Expropriation rally which will be held at Thembalethu Stadium in George. -TNA Reporter
