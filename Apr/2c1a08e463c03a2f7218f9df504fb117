ALLEGATIONS of gatekeeping and corruption at primary school level has forced the postponement of School Governing Body elections at a Lamontville school. Parents were left bloodied last month when a fight broke out at the office of Ntuthukweni Primary School principal, Busi Tsekiso Kheswa. A parent who wished to remain anonymous fearing victimisation of his child, said the voters roll had been tampered with in the lead up to the elections which were due to be two weeks ago. The parent said when he came to the school to confirm that his name was on the roll on March 18, he was surprised to find that his name no longer reflected a parent of a child registered at the school. “Our names no longer appear on the voters roll yet we pay school fees and attend meetings at the school but today we don’t exist because we won’t let Kheswa do as she pleases. When we went to ask her (Kheswa) why our names were not appearing on the voters roll, men came in and attacked us while we sat with her at her office. She’s gatekeeping to make sure that her allies become the SGB, she’ll need their support in order to keep her job,” the parent said. The embattled principal, who faces an uncertain future at the school, is alleged to have been one of the beneficiaries of post fixing. Her appointment was called into question when it came to light that she had not been the preferred candidate. When The New Age called Kheswa, she hung up and switched off her phone. Meanwhile, the injured parent is demanding justice be carried out. “A protection order has been served on the men who attacked us,” the parent said. The police confirmed that a case was opened for investigation on March 20 in relation to the attack at the school. –SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO|provinces@thenewage.co.za
