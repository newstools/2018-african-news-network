The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) said it is shocked and disappointed by the announcement that one service provider could hold the country to ransom by having the power to switch the criminal justice system off. Scopa said this raises a question whether SAPS is renting the equipment from Forensic Data Analysts (FDA) or owns it. The committee was reacting to reports that the use of and access to Property Control and Exhibit Management (PCEM) and Firearm Permit System (FPS) will be suspended by FDA unless an appropriate agreement could be reached with SAPS before system shutdown. In November, Scopa instructed the SAPS and the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) to terminate multimillion-rand contracts with the service provider as it said they were of a corrupt nature. Scopa spokesperson Faith Ndenze said Scopa was also wondering what kind of contracts were entered into with FDA because the arrangement was a betrayal of the national interest. “The committee believes that this matter should be attended to expeditiously if SAPS and government are serious about national security. “Secondly, the call Scopa made not to continue with the payments of the contract arose from the fact that the officials themselves were questioning the legality of the contracts. “Scopa then said if there is illegality, the officials should not pay. Scopa did not just make the call in a vacuum, the call was informed by the concerns from the officials,” Ndenze said. She said the committee is scheduled to meet with SAPS management to clarify matters relating to various contracts including the FDA one which will be prioritised in the light of the current developments. -TNA Reporter
