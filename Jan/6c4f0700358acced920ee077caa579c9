City of Tshwane Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga says he has decided not to report threats on his life from ANC Youth League leader Bokamoso Mantashe but has promised he will have to take action if the threats persist. Mantashe allegedly attacked Msimanga in a Facebook post in which he is said to have used derogatory words and accused the mayor of being a former beauty king. The post, which was was later deleted, said: “Solly, former Mamelodi beauty king, we are coming 4 you this Friday, bloody die white puppet.” Msimanga said Mantashe’s utterances were completely unacceptable. He said he would continue to monitor whether the ANCYL leader and others continued to post other threatening messages against him. “I will monitor the comments made by this individual and others like him who elect to use these communication platforms to launch insults and send threats instead of lodging genuine concerns about service delivery issues in the city,” Msimanga said. Msimanga said he believes Mantashe’s comment was likely made in anticipation of an illegal march scheduled for Friday in which the ANCYL in the greater Tshwane region has threatened to shut down the city. He said he hoped that the comment was written in Mantashe’s personal capacity and that the ANC and the Youth League would condemn it with the contempt it deserved. Attempts to get a comment from ANC and ANCYL in Tshwane were unsuccessful. -TNA Reporter
