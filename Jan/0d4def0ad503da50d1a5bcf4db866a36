Cosatu has described as horrifying a report by The Star newspaper on Wednesday that a farmer allegedly forced an employee to drink two litres of faeces before attempting to drown him in a septic tank. The trade union federation said it was “deeply angered” by the incident and condemned the abuse of farm workers by a farmer in Springs. Police officers at the Springs police station reportedly refused to help the victim open a case. Cosatu has called on the relevant authorities to investigate the allegations, as they are disturbing. The trade union federation also said it also wanted to see the police officials, who refused to attend to the complaint of the victim, held accountable. Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said: “This story is a reminder that there is still modern day slavery thriving on our farms. Not only do workers experience extreme exploitation but they also suffer from physical and psychological abuse in the workplace. Their precarious working and living conditions can be equated to modern-day slavery, a step above the grave.” Pamla said farm workers have been let down badly by the system, law enforcement agencies, government departments and democratic institutions like the Human Rights Commission. “They are dismissed arbitrarily without the employers following proper disciplinary procedures as set out in our labour laws and evicted without regard to legal processes and not given sufficient time notification or alternative housing.” Cosatu has also challenged Afriforum and the Transvaal Agricultural Union(TAU) to take interest in the conditions of farm workers, not only farm owners. -TNA Reporter
