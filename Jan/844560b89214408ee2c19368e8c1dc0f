KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development Themba Mthembu has welcome the decision to deny bail to a farmer who stands accused of killing a man in his farm early this year. Local farmer Edward Phillip Solomon was remanded in custody following a failed bid to secure bail after he was arrested for shooting and killing his former farm worker, Mondli Lembede, following a fracas between the two men. Mthembu said the decision handed down by the New Hanover Magistrate court sent a strong message to the people who marginalised farm workers and farm dwellers. He called on all farming communities in the province to maintain peace and harmony within its members in order to foster a prosperous agricultural community formed on the values of non-racial, non-sexist and democratic society underpinned by human rights and freedoms. -TNA Reporter
