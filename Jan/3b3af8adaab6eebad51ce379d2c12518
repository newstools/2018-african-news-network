While Matric pupils celebrate their results, not to be outdone are the country’s prison inmates who achieved a 76.7% pass rate improving the results by 4.6% from 2016. On Friday the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) announced that it achieved its highest pass rate after registering 223 matriculants, the highest number since the inception of formal education in 2007. “Correctional Services has not only increased the number of matriculants, but the quality of results has been increasing over the years. The 76.7% pass rate is comprised of 48 bachelors, 55 Diplomas, and 39 higher certificates. This is an enormous upsurge when compared to the 2016 academic year as it only registered 40 bachelors, 47 diplomas, and 12 certificate pass respectively,” said the Department in a statement. Yesterday Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga announced that the overall national pass rate had increased by just more than 3% to 75.1% from last year’s 72%. This year’s best-performing inmate is Samkelo Mpofana from Usethubeni Youth Centre in the Durban Westville Correctional Centre. Mpofana obtained five distinctions in IsiZulu, English, Life Orientation, History and Tourism.
Two other inmates, Senzo Fundzo and Sicelo Chili, from the same school, respectively obtained three distinctions. Acting National Commissioner of Correctional Services, James Smalberger congratulated the inmates and teachers for their achievements and strong work ethic. “Education is not the only avenue towards recovering and protecting one’s dignity in a correctional facility, but it is a major one. Further to that, it offers a modicum of the authority required of a person for self-creation,” said Smalberger. -TNA Reporter
