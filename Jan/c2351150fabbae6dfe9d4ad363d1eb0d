The EFF has called on the Basic Education Department to build more schools in the city of Mbombela in Mpumalanga. On Tuesday, the party led a march against Laerskool Nelspruit, Nellie Miere pre-school, Bergvlam Primary and Nelspruit Primary, to submit a memorandum in support of parents whose children were refused admission by the schools. The party has also called for a balance in the number of Afrikaans and English classes. EFF leader in Mpumalanga Collen Sidibe said the party had received complains that there were a number of students that were still on the waiting list, since the beginning of the academic year. “As things stand, the children are missing out on education,” Sidibe said. Sidibe said the EFF was also demanding that the schools increase a number of subjects that are being offered in English and stop providing the majority of subjects in Afrikaans. “We want them to balance Afrikaans and English.” -TNA Reporter
