A group of protesters in EFF regalia have staged various protests at H&M stores around the country.   The fashion retailer came under attack on Tuesday for an advertisement featuring a black child modelling a shirt with the slogan “coolest monkey in the jungle”. The ad was widely criticised for being racist and the company subsequently apologised. ​H&M has withdrawn and apologised for the advert. ​ It is reported that H&M stores in Sandton, Menlyn Park and East Rand have been affected by the protests.
