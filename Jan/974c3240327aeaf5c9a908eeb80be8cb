The City of Johannesburg on Tuesday apologised to residents for the shortage of chemical supplies that led to the closure of public swimming pools over the festive season. “As a member of the Mayoral committee for community development, I wish to apologise to the residents of the city of Johannesburg for the inconvenience caused by the closure of some of the city pools due to a shortage of chemicals. “This was regrettable. The closure of the pools was notable especially because it was incurred during the hottest days in the city,” the city of Joburg said in a statement. A number of pools were closed due to the lack of chemicals in Alexandra and other areas. The City of Joburg says that it has since resolved the matter in relation to the shortage of the pool chemicals and reassures the public that it would work hard to make sure that something of this nature does not happen again. -TNA Reporter
