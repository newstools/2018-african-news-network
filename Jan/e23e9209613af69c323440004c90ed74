Cosatu says it is deeply angered and disgusted by cowardly attacks directed at farm workers and farm dwellers by racist white farmers across the country. This after a tractor driver was in killed in Krugersdorp on Saturday. It is alleged that the 32-year-old worker was shot dead by his employer over the use of a his tractor. It’s understood the worker used the vehicle to go to the shops during his lunch break. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters said the police were investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. She said the suspect was expected to appear in court soon. Cosatu has called for swift action against what it’s labelled “racist barbarians on a rampage, killing black vulnerable workers”. Spokesperson Sizwe Pamla has called on law enforcement agencies to take action against those who kill farm workers. “The law enforcement agencies need to do their jobs before people are tempted to take the law into their own hands,” Pamla said. Pamla said dozens of farm workers were killed and illegally evicted every day, not by some unknown criminals but by their own employers and law enforcement agencies were failing to act. “These unredeemable and unreformed racists need to be arrested because they do not have a monopoly on violence and people are going to run out of patience soon.” This is the second killing, allegedly at the hands of a farm employer in the space of less than a week. Last week, a mourner was shot and killed in in Cramond, Pietermaritzburg after he had an argument with the farmer who owned the land where a burial was taking place. The farmer did not want his employee to be buried on his farm.   -TNA Reporter
