The Hawks are investigating the legality of 323 firearms confiscated at a dealership in Pretoria on Thursday. The dealership owner was reportedly placed under scrutiny in December following reports that the establishment was in possession of firearms illegally. The Hawks then launched a compliance inspection in terms of the Firearms Control Act from 17 to 25 January, which resulted in the seizure of the guns and related documentation. Hawks spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha said the dealership could not account for the number of firearms it had on record. “The prescriptions of the Firearms Control Act are being followed in this regard and pending the outcome thereof, charges of negligent loss of firearms or failure to report the loss of firearms will be added for investigation. The seized firearms will be subjected to further forensic analysis in order to establish their origins and whether they were used in the commission of any criminal offences,” Ramovha said. Ramovha said the Hawks would continue to intensify operations to seize firearms from people involved in firearm trafficking, illegal distribution and legal entities involved in corruption and other illegal practices. -TNA Reporter
