Crime Intelligence officer Morris ‘Captain KGB’ Tshabalala is expected to appear in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Friday for a formal bail application after his case was postponed on Thursday. Tshabalala is accused of defrauding the Crime Intelligence secret service of over R500 000. He made a brief appearance in court on Thursday on five charges related to fraud, theft and corruption. At the time of his arrest, Tshabalala reportedly said he was not employed, leading to a decision to postpone his bail application. His bail application case was postponed for 24 hours in order for the prosecution to verify his employment status at the South African Service. -TNA Reporter
