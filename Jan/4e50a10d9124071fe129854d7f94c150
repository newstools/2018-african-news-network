Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba has passed his condolences on to the family of two female Metro Police Department officers who were killed by a drunk driver at a roadside checkpoint in Fourways on Monday. Mashaba said he was bereaved that the city lost more JMPD officers in such a manner. “It is believed that the driver who caused the accident was severely intoxicated at the time of the incident. Over the course of the past weekend alone, the JMPD arrested 308 drunk drivers in Johannesburg.” The driver of the double cab was arrested on the scene and blood samples were taken. It was later confirmed that the driver was three times over the limit, with more intoxicating substances found in the vehicle. He is currently detained at the Sandton police station. The Department of Public Safety has recently launched a pilot project which aims to make JMPD officers more visible to approaching traffic while on duty, by wearing a body-light device on their uniform. The department further said it would not tolerate reckless and criminal behavior, adding that driving under the influence does not only put one’s life in danger but also puts the lives of other road users at risk. -TNA Reporter
