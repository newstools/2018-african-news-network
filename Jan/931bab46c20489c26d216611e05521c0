Netcare 911 has warned parents about the dangers of leaving children in unattended cars while they do their shopping. The warning came after a man left his four children in a locked car at Woodlands Mall in Pretoria at the weekend. Netcare 911 spokesperson Tebogo Magoro said the children, aged four, seven, nine and 11, were discovered by a member of the public who saw the 11-year-old panicking and trying to get the attention of passers by. “They tried to explain to the 11-year-old how to unlock the vehicle but she couldn’t. One managed to get hold of the father who then gave them permission to break one of the back windows to get the children out,” Magoro said. Magoro said the father told them that he had left the children in the care of a friend. He said a security guard told Emergency Services that the car had been parked in the sun for three to four hours. Magoro said the children were given minor attention by paramedics and were later released into the care of their father. -TNA Reporter
