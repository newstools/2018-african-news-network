Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is taking a North Gauteng High Court ruling, forcing him to return R11 million to the power utility, to the Supreme Court of Appeal. Last week, the North Gauteng High Court ruled that Molefe’s controversial reinstatement at the state-owned company last year was unlawful, and therefore set aside. Molefe was also ordered to pay back any amount he received as part of a much-contested R30m pension payout. Molefe was ordered to pay back the money within 10 days from the date of the order. He was also ordered to pay the costs of two attorneys in the case. -TNA Reporter
