The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) says it will on Monday démarche the second in charge at the US Embassy in Pretoria, Jessye Lapenn, following recent comments by President Donald Trump. Last week, Trump said African countries‚ alongside Haiti and El Savador‚ constituted “sh**holes” from where migrants into the US were undesirable. He has since denied calling any country a “sh**hole”. Dirco said it would give Lapenn an opportunity to explain Trump’s statement. Spokesperson Clayson Monyela said the department had noted Trump’s tweet on Friday in which he denied making the crude and offensive statement. He said Dirco further noted that Trump’s denial was not categorical, referring only to Haiti and not addressing the entirety of the statement. “South Africa aligns itself with the statements issued by the African Union and the Africa group of Ambassadors to the United Nations in New York. Africa is united in its affirmation of the dignity of the people of Africa and the African diaspora,” Monyela said. He said relations between South Africa and the United States and between the rest of Africa and the United States must be based on mutual respect and understanding. -TNA Reporter
