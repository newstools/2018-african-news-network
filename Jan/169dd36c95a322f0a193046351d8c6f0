One person died on Tuesday morning following an accident on the M1 North at Empire Road in Johannesburg. The accident, which involved a bus and truck, caused major traffic delays. Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Edna Mamonyane urged all motorists to use the M2 and then to take the off-ramp onto Joe Slovo, to connect with the M1 at Houghton. She said the clearing of the scene would take a while. The highway was reportedly closed as well. AVOID M1N!
