A traffic officer employed by the Gauteng traffic department will on Monday appear in the Pretoria Commercial Crimes Court on charges of corruption and extortion. The 57-year-old was arrested following a complaint made by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) hotline. The officer is alleged to have removed motor vehicle licence discs and taken drivers licences from motorists under the pretext that they had committed a traffic offence. “The victims would then allegedly be instructed to deliver a sum of money ranging from R1500 to the officer at the regional offices of the provincial traffic department in exchange for their documents,” RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said. Zwane said that during the arrest, a number of licences and motor vehicle discs were found. He said attempts would be made to obtain statements from the owners of the documents. -TNA Reporter
