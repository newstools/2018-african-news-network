Deputy Higher Education and Training Minister Buti Manamela will visit the University of South Africa (Unisa) in Pretoria on Wednesday. The visit forms part the deputy minister’s engagement process, in preparation for the 2018 academic year. I’m meeting with @unisa this morning, plus our Department met with Vice Chancellors, Registrars, SRC’s and NSFAS to clear the air. Some universities or their officials may choose to do otherwise, which will derail registration. https://t.co/UjNjVyLkuL — DM Higher Education (@ButiManamela) January 24, 2018 During his visit, Manamela will meet with the leadership of the National Education‚ Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) and Unisa management, before briefing the media.
