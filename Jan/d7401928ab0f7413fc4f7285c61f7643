Hundreds of African National Congress (ANC) supporters who are attending #ANC106 spent a night on the Luthuli House pavement after buses were delayed. The supporters, however, remained joyous in the morning, singing, chanting and looking forward to their trip to the East London where the #ANC106 celebration will take place. According to reports a number of them were carrying luggage, blankets food, while others were blowing vuvuzelas. A 57-year-old Evelyn Sithole, reportedly said that even though she slept outside Luthuli House, she is still looking forward to the celebration. -TNA Reporter Â
