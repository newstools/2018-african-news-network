Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo on Tuesday said he is waiting for the release of the terms of reference of the commission that will investigate allegations of state capture before anyone can be appointed to help him with the probe. Zondo was speaking during his first briefing on the progress made since President Jacob Zuma appointed him as the chairperson of the commission of inquiry that will look into allegations of state capture in relation to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report. In her report, released in 2016, Madonsela instructed Zuma to appoint a judge handpicked by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to investigate her findings. Zondo said he was waiting for the terms of reference of the commission to be published in the Government Gazette. “Once the terms of reference are announced, we will need the services of a secretary of the commission, a team of lawyers and investigators to investigate and corroborate whatever evidence we find,” Zondo said. He said he was considering certain names but would make that known in due course. He said he did not know how long it would take before the terms of reference of the commission would be released. Zondo said, when he met the president to speak about his appointment to the commission, he was informed by the president that the Presidency would have a team that would help him with the commission’s work. -TNA Reporter
