Metrorail in Cape Town on Wednesday suspended central line train services following a shooting incident. The suspension came after a security guard providing an armed escort was fatally shot on Tuesday evening at the Chris Hani station in Khayelitsha. “At this stage, prevailing crime in the area still threatens Metrorail’s ability to render a service to commuters in the area. Without assurance that the situation is under control, we will not be able to operate,” Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker said. Commuters have been asked to find alternative transport as Metrorail has no buses to offer as alternative transport. However, Metrorail monthly/weekly ticket holders may utilise Golden Arrow buses. -TNA Reporter
