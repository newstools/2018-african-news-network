Opposition parties the United Democratic Movement (UDM) and Cope want President Jacob Zuma to personally guarantee payment of R1million before bringing his State Capture appeal application. According to a notice to demand security for costs filed by the parties, they fear that President Zuma will not be able to pay the legal costs if and when he loses the appeal. In December the President announced his intention to appeal a North Gauteng High Court judgment which found his grounds to review former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report to have no merit. Cope and the UDM have on Wednesday, however, labeled Zuma’s intended appeal “an extension of the reckless conduct identified in the judgment”. The President is arguing that the High Court was wrong to say he was ill-advised in challenging advocate Madonsela’s report. At the top of the year, Zuma established a Commission of Inquiry into State Capture as per the orders of the North Gauteng High Court.
