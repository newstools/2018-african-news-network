Olympic gymnastics superstar Simone Biles confirmed on Monday she was sexually abused by former USA team doctor Larry Nassar, who was last month jailed for 60 years on child porn charges. In a statement posted on Twitter, Biles said she had wrestled with her decision to go public with her story since the scandal broke. “Most of you know me as a happy, giggly, and energetic girl,” the 20-year-old reigning Olympic all-around champion wrote. “But lately I’ve felt a bit broken and the more I try to shut off the voice in my head the louder it screams. I am not afraid to tell my story anymore. “I too am one of the many survivors that was sexually abused by Larry Nassar,” the 10-time World Championship medallist added. -AFP
