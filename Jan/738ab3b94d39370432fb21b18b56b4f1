AIRLINE FlySafair yesterday said that despite predictions that global travel prices would rise sharply this year, South Africans can continue to expect affordable domestic air ticket prices. Kirby Gordon, head of sales and distribution, said: “A strengthening rand means we will be able to offset the increase in oil prices for a little longer than we would have with a stagnant or weakening currency.” This is particularly good news in light of the 2018 global travel forecast, conducted by the Global Business Travel Association Foundation in conjunction with Carlson Wagonlit Travel, which last year predicted that air travel would rise by as much as 7% in some regions across the world in 2018. “Contrary to international trends, domestic passenger numbers in South Africa in 2017 exhibited no growth against 2016’s figures, but the local market continues to be characterised by strong and healthy competition, which plays an important part in keeping costs down,” Gordon said. FlySafair reported price decreases of as much as 39% on some of the routes which it operated. FlySafair is a domestic low-cost carrier operating from OR Tambo, Lanseria, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, George, East London and Durban. -BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
