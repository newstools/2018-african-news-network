A blaze broke out in the ventilation system of Trump Tower in New York on Monday, seriously injuring one person, the fire department said. The fire started on the roof shortly before 7 am (1200 GMT) in the Fifth Avenue skyscraper, which is President Donald Trump’s private home in New York and houses the headquarters of his company, which is today run by his two adult sons. Twenty-six units of 84 fire fighters were mobilized to quench the blaze, which was under control just over an hour later, said fire department spokesman Ken Reilly. “There was a small electrical fire in a cooling tower on the roof of Trump Tower,” the president’s second son, Eric Trump, tweeted. “The New York Fire Department was here within minutes and did an incredible job,” he added. One person was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, Reilly said. The US president has spent little time in New York since his inauguration a year ago, but has a private triplex home at the top of Trump Tower. The glass building was also his presidential campaign headquarters and is home to private apartments. -AFP
