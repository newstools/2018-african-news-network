The accused has been granted R10 000 bail with condition that he hands in his firearm and passport.The matter will be back in court on April 13. Tractor driver Aron Mutavhatsindi from Limpopo was shot and killed last week on an accusation that he stole the tractor. The incident led to an uproar on social media after his images were shared with the public labeling it as a racial attack. There was confusion that the man was killed by a farm owner, however, it was later revealed that the suspect in the matter was a security officer from the farm. Political parties and civil organizations have since condemned the incident. Economic Freedom Fighters Julius Malema said that the party would be at the court during the Security officer’s appearance on Monday. “Today we are in West Rand where a white security guard killed a person who went to buy food with a tractor and this white security guard also is not for the first time he does what he did to this black person. He has got cases of assault and similar nature in other provinces.” South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has condemned the fatal shooting and promised that their lawyers would offer the family legal assistance. “We also believe that our lawyers should come in and help the family so that a proper civil claim is undertaken against this perpetrator,” Sanco said. The perpetrator handed himself to the police after the incident and has remained in custody. -TNA Reporter
