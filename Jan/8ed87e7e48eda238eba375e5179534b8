The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) has condemned the decision by the Eskom board to re-instate Eskom’s former acting CEO Matshela Koko and Acting head of group capital Prish Govender to their positions. In July last year, Eskom interim Chairperson Zethembe Khoza announced that the board will pursue disciplinary action against Mr Koko in line with labour processes. Koko was placed on special leave in March following media reports that his stepdaughter, Koketso Chomo, had unduly benefited from contracts awarded by Eskom. Numsa said Koko was disciplined for nepotism and failing to declare a conflict of interest regarding his step-daughters ownership of shares in a company which was awarded more than a billion rand in contracts by an Eskom division which he led. Prish Govender was implicated in the scandal involving consulting firm McKinsey where he is alleged to have paid monies to the firm, in a contract which has since been declared unlawful and void by Eskom. Koko will resume his duties on Monday as Head of Generation, while Govender will be reinstated as head of Group Capital after a dodgy disciplinary process cleared them of all charges. “Numsa is disturbed that there seems to be a pattern emerging at Eskom where processes are abused in order to ensure that certain compromised executives are protected from taking responsibility for corruption. “For over 10 years the Eskom board and management team has been characterized by gross mismanagement, wasteful expenditure and corruption. Instead of dealing decisively with the looters, the board has found creative ways to reward thievery and fraudulent behavior,” Numsa said. -TNA Reporter
