Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is on Tuesday expected to visit Trompsburg Primary School in the Free State as part of her department’s oversight and monitoring of schools as the year starts. Department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said: “The minister will also take the opportunity to engage with the community and encourage those who do not have a matric certificate to take advantage of the second chance matric support programme.” The Free State is one of the provinces that achieved a matric pass rate of over 80%, resulting in it becoming the number one province in the country. During her announcement of the results in Johannesburg earlier this month, Motshekga praised improvements made in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo, adding that the department would continue to pay particular attention to the three provinces so that the overall performance of pupils throughout the grades would be improved. “We should always remember that if we have to further improve the outcomes of the schooling system, we will have to continue to improve the fundamental quality of teaching and learning, well before Grade 12,” Motshekga said at the time. -TNA Reporter
