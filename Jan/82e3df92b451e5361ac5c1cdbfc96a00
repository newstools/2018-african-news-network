The ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) says it’s disgusted by reports that the Reiger Park High School principal allegedly had sexual relationships with pupils at the school. The league has said the school’s principal has brought shame upon the teaching profession and has called for his immediate resignation. The ANCWL was responding to the emergence of videos and pictures, on various social media platforms, of the headmaster having sex with pupils in his office. League spokesperson Meokgo Matuba said the principal abused his position of authority by coercing young girls and turning them into his sex slaves. “The ANCWL encourages all pupils who might have fallen prey to this paedophile to report to law enforcement agencies. Any of his former colleagues who might have collaborated with him must face the law,” Matuba said. She said the league was encouraged by the Gauteng Department of Education’s decision to deploy a psycho-social unit to provide counselling to all affected pupils and assist parents on how to interact with the police. The ANCWL has also called on South Africans to support the young girls implicated in the videos. Meanwhile, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has called on people who are in possession of the videos and photos to stop sharing them, and to delete them. Lesufi said being in possession of the pictures is not only immoral but illegal. He said his department would fast-track the dismissal of the principal from the school. -TNA Reporter
