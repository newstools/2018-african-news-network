City of Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba said the complainant was looking for a stand in the Vlakfontein area and was introduced to the second accused who allegedly told him that he was working for the Thembelihle Development Trust, which was assisting people to buy stands in the area. The complainant was allegedly told to pay R5000 for the stand and after paying, the second accused told him to come on a weekend to choose a stand which he liked. “The complainant alleged that he started building the foundation of the house on the stand he chose and when the walls were still being built, the complainant alleged that he was told by his builders that an ANC Councillor (Dan Bovu) stopped them from continuing with building the house. “He allegedly left his contact details with the builders so that the complainant could call him,” Mashaba said. After he contacted Bovu, the complainant was allegedly told to pay a deposit of between R2000 and R4000 into the account of the Thembelihle Development Trust. “The complainant allegedly paid R2000 into an account number that was given to him.  He then continued to build until the building was complete,” he said. Joburg ANC spokesperson Jolidee Matongo said the case was never prosecuted and re-emerged in 2015 where prosecutors declined to prosecute due to lack of evidence. “Corruption has no place in this administration and we will work tirelessly, and in collaboration with institutions such as the Hawks, the SAPS and the NPA to ensure that the residents of Johannesburg receive the quality services they deserve,” Mashaba said. -TNA Reporter
