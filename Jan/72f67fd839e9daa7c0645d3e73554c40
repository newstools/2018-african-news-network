Presiding officers of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL) will from Wednesday to Friday visit 15 secondary schools in the Tshwane region education district. The visit forms part of the institution’s School Readiness Programme for the 2018 academic year. Towards the end of 2017, the Gauteng department of education’s executive authority painted a bleak picture relating to the department’s financial situation, underpinning several constraints which may mean some pupils and prospective learners may not find schools in 2018. The visits are aimed at assessing the schools’ state of readiness ahead of the new academic year.
