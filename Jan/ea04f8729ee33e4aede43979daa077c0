MULTICHOICE SOUTH AFRICA PRESS STATEMENT ON ITS CARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH THE TV CHANNEL ANN7 AND OF GOVERNMENT LOBBYING  Issued 31 January 2018       Concerns about MultiChoice’s relationship with ANN7 and questions about how it lobbied Government were raised in the media in November 2017.  As a result, the MultiChoice Audit and Risk Committees came together to assess:     PROCESS  The Committee was chaired by Don Eriksson CA (SA), and comprised four non-executive directors and independent non-executive director, Advocate Kgomotso Moroka (SC), who was seconded to the Committee. The Committee undertook the review on behalf of the Board. The review was strengthened by the engagement of the services of attorneys Webber Wentzel (legal advice on lobbying and contracts) and an independent audit firm (forensics and payments).  The committee conducted a thorough and comprehensive review. They met several times, studied all relevant contracts, reviewed five years of related payments information and emails, interviewed those involved and did various objective contract and cost comparisons.  The period of review for the scope of work was determined as 1 January 2012 to 30 November 2017.  COMMITTEE FINDINGS  The Committee found procedural shortcomings, but found no evidence of corruption or other illegal activity.  Specifically:  On ANN7 carriage contract    The committee’s analysis of the ANN7 contract highlighted the complexity of negotiating a start-up local news channel – a process which is very costly. The negotiations with ANN7 began at a time when MultiChoice wanted to add local black voices to reflect more diverse local news coverage on the DStv platform. In addition, annual payments to eTV had escalated substantially, heading towards R500m p.a. The commercial rationale was to assist in the development of the new ANN7 channel by contributing to their costs and allow it a reasonable term of three/five years to develop. Should it fail, MultiChoice would let the agreement lapse at the end of the period, as allowed for in the contract.         PROCEDURAL SHORTCOMINGS  The Committee believes that a number of procedures can be improved:     MULTICHOICE ACTIONS  The MultiChoice board has accepted the findings and recommendations of the MultiChoice Audit & Risk Committee.  MultiChoice has confirmed the following five actions:       MultiChoice continues to believe that the wide range of foreign and local news channels (SABC and ENCA) on our platform – representing widely divergent views, needs to be supplemented with another local voice. In particular, a black-owned and run channel that represents the majority of people in this country. The successful bid will have to meet the following criteria:     MultiChoice South Africa’s Chief Executive Officer, Calvo Mawela, responds:  “This has been a humbling experience for MultiChoice. While we entered into an agreement for the ANN7 channel at a time that the extent of State Capture was unknown, we fully understand the outrage of the public regarding endemic corruption in our country and accept we should have dealt with the concerns around ANN7 far more swiftly.  There’s also no doubt that we managed our communication of this issue poorly.  While I am pleased that the investigation into the ANN7 contract did not discover any corruption or other illegal activity, the questions we have faced have been sobering.  We made mistakes and must now embark on a path of restoring public trust.”  On Imtiaz Patel and the SABC  IMTIAZ PATEL:  As part of the review, the MultiChoice Audit & Risk Committee also commented on allegations concerning Imtiaz Patel’s relationship with the Guptas.  MultiChoice notes that there have been concerns raised around his prior connection to the Guptas as well as the suggestion of inappropriate influence regarding MultiChoice’s dealings with ANN7.  Following the Committee’s work and enquiries made by Naspers, it is clear that Imtiaz Patel’s previous relationship with the Guptas predates his appointment at MultiChoice, played no role in the terms negotiated for the ANN7 channel, and that he acted in the interests of the company. The ANN7 channel was negotiated as a collective by members of the senior management team.  MULTICHOICE AGREEMENT WITH THE SABC  MultiChoice’s agreement with SABC has also been questioned. It should be noted that the MultiChoice contract with SABC did not form part of the brief given to the Audit and Risk committee. However, to be clear, Parliament has referred a number of third party agreements to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), among them the SABC agreement. MultiChoice is co-operating fully with this investigation.  Naspers CEO and MultiChoice Board member, Bob van Dijk concluded,  “MultiChoice is a great South African company built on a spirit of entrepreneurial endeavour. But the presently polarised political environment in South Africa and controversy around the ANN7 channel ownership demanded a higher level of diligence and scrutiny than was the practice previously. That said, I am pleased that the committee found no evidence of corruption.  I can also confirm that the committee and Naspers found that Imtiaz Patel’s previous relationship with the Guptas played no role in the negotiation of the ANN7 contract at any time. It is clear that he always acted in the best interests of MultiChoice.  I want to be clear: MultiChoice South Africa is a company committed to black empowerment and economic transformation, and is fully aligned with the values of modern South Africa. We will make sure we take all necessary steps to restore public trust in MultiChoice as a company committed to making a positive impact in this country.”
