Former public protector Thuli Madonsela says she was delighted with President Jacob Zumaâ€™s decision to finally establish a commission of inquiry into state capture, as she recommended in her report in 2016. Madonsela said she was however disappointed that it took the president this long to establish the commission. On Tuesday, Zuma announced that he would be establishing a commission of inquiry to look into allegations of state capture. He announced that he would be appointing Deputy Chief Justice Ray Zondo, who will chair the commission, as directed by Madonsela. Madonsela recommended that Zuma appoint a judge chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to head up the inquiry. Madonsela said, due to the length it took for the president to appoint the commission, some evidence may have been lost. -TNA Reporter
