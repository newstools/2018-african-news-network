The Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Finance Yunus Carrim has confirmed that parliamentary hearings on the Steinhoff scandal will be held at the end of January. “Depending on the outstanding administrative issues, the hearing will begin on the 30th or 31st of January.” Carrim also rejected rumours that the hearings are being held at the request of David Maynier. “Actually, I acted immediately after the issue broke out and decided that the Committee would have to have hearings on this matter well before Maynier wrote to me and rushed to the media. I also received a call from the Eff chief Whip Floyd Shivambu regarding the matter,” he said. Carrim said he wrote to a number of organisations, including the South African Reserve Bank, Financial Service Board and JSE informing them about the pending hearings and requesting terms of reference of the FSB investigation into Steinhoff and the possible timelines for the completion of the investigation. -TNA Reporter
