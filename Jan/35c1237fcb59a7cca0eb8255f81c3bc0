The city of Johannesburg has announced Rea Vaya services are now live on Google Maps. According to city, residents and visitors can now use Google Maps to get information on Rea Vaya bus routes, bus stops and stations, as well as bus times. Member of the mayoral committee for transport councilor Nonhlanhla Makhuba said: “Adding Rea Vaya services to Google Maps is another step for the city of Johannesburg to become a smart city.” Makhuba said Google Maps allows commuters to do a point-to-point search anywhere in the city. “This will also be a great help for visitors and tourists who are used to using the public transport functionality in other cities around the world.” This is a partnership between the city of Johannesburg, Google and the Gauteng department of roads and transport. This project lays the foundation for adding other modes of public transport as well as real-time tracking of public transport vehicles on Google Maps. It will also enhance the accuracy and usability of public transport. -TNA Reporter
