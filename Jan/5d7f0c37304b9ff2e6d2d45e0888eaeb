Areas that were affected by the storm included Protea Glen, Bramfischerville, Snake Park, Lefureng, Fleurhof, Lenasia, Lawley and Kagiso. The community members have blamed Cosmopolitan and Kiron properties for shoddy work and stated that they need to be held accountable. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said Randfontein Road near Protea Glen is currently affected by the go-slow and motorists should find alternative routes. -TNA Reporter
