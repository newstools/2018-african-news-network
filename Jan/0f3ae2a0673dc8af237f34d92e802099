Eight Iraqis were killed on Saturday, most of them security personnel, in a US air strike that apparently targeted them by mistake, a provincial official said. “Eight people — a senior intelligence official, five policemen and a woman — were killed by a US strike on the centre of Al-Baghdadi,” a town in western Iraq, the official said, asking not to be identified. “It seems the strike was a mistake,” the official said of the incident in the Euphrates Valley town, adjacent to the Ain al-Asad airbase 250 kilometres (160 miles) west of the capital.
