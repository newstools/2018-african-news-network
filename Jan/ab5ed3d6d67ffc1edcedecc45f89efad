Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) MEC Panyaza Lesufi has described a decision by the North Gauteng High Court to overturn his department’s instruction that Hoerskool Overvaal registers 55 extra pupils as disappointing. Lesufi was reacting to Judge Bill Prinsloo’s ruling to uphold an application brought by Hoerskool Overvaal to have the department’s instruction set aside. “We will appeal this decision all the way to the Constitutional Court if necessary. We want to see if the Constitutional Court will also legalise racism,” Lesufi said. On Monday, Prinsloo said the department had failed to investigate whether the school was in a position to admit additional students and whether it had reached full capacity. He also criticised the department for the heavy-handedness shown when dealing with the Afrikaans-only school. Lesufi described the ruling as devastating and a major setback for the transformation agenda. -TNA Reporter
