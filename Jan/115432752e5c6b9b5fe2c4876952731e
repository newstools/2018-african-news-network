The Department of Military Veterans, together with the South African National Military Veterans Association, held a joint media briefing earlier today, to discuss education support. The briefing focused on the progress, achievements and challenges faced, as well as mitigating factors that have been put in place regarding education support. Department spokesperson Mbulelo Musi said, when military veterans started assisting in 2013, the department’s first intake was just 200 students, for both basic and higher education. “The department had planned to support 4500 military veterans and their dependents in the 2017-18 financial year, however, to date it has supported 7 712,” Musi said. In the 2017 academic year, the department provided education support to 7 712 military veterans and beneficiaries. This year, the department has received 9 645 new applications. Musi said they were also aware that there were glitches in payments in the previous academic year but indicated that the department has been working on those glitches. “The department takes full responsibility for the defaulted payments and assures that this matter is addressed as a matter of urgency and therefore calls upon all the affected institutions to treat the payment defaulting students considerately. “We call all the military veterans community to bear with the department and assist the smooth resolution of the challenges relating to the education support programme. We urge the students who have not submitted their continuing applications to do so by 31 January 2018, to assist the department in finalising the processing of applications for 2018.” -TNA Reporter
